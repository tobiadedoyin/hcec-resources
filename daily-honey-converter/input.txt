LESSON 1:	THE POWER OF THANKSGIVING

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 50:14 -15

Learn by Heart: "Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High”, Psalm 50:14.

Thanksgiving is not just a ritual; it is a key that unlocks God’s favour and intervention. The Psalmist reminds us that offering thanks to God is a sacred act of worship that attracts His presence. When we express gratitude to God, we acknowledge Him as the source of all blessings and the One who deserves our praise. It is a way of surrendering our will to His, showing that we trust Him, even in uncertain times. True thanksgiving flows from a heart that remembers God’s past mercies and remains expectant of His continued goodness.
	
Furthermore, thanksgiving sets the stage for divine deliverance. The Scripture assures that when we combine gratitude with our vows and prayers, God listens and intervenes in time of trouble. A thankful heart glorifies God not only for what He has done, but also for what He is yet to do. Many battles are won in the secret place of gratitude, because it shifts our focus from problems to the greatness of God. Are you facing a challenge today? Choose to thank God and watch how His deliverance will bring glory to His Name.

Challenge: Cultivate the habit of daily thanksgiving. Write down three things you can be grateful to God for and offer them in prayer.

Prayer: Lord, give me a heart of gratitude in every circumstance. Let my thanksgiving open the door for Your divine intervention.


LESSON 2:	UNITY IN CHRIST

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 1:1-13.

Learn by Heart: “That there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought”, 1 Corinthians 1:10.

Division plagued the Corinthian Church. Some followed Paul, others Apollos, still others Peter. Paul urged them to return to the one foundation, Christ crucified. He knew a divided church misrepresents the Saviuor. Unity is not uniformity; it does not erase diversity. Rather, it is oneness of heart and purpose. It means we may differ in style, background, or culture, yet we remain united in our allegiance to Christ. The cross is greater than personal preference.

Paul calls us to be of “one mind and one judgment.” This unity is possible only through the Spirit. Left to ourselves, we drift into pride and division. But when Christ rules, humility takes root, and love binds us together. For today’s church, unity is vital. The world watches and often dismisses our message because it sees our divisions. But when the church lives in unity, it becomes a powerful testimony of the Gospel. Jesus Himself prayed, “That they may be one, so that the world may believe” (John 17:21). Unity is not optional—it is central to our witness.

Challenge: Examine your heart. Are there grudges, preferences, or biases that keep you from unity with fellow believers? Ask God to soften your spirit and remind you that the Church belongs to Christ, not us. 

Prayer: Father, help me to choose unity and Christ’s cross that bring oneness that glorifies You.


LESSON 3:			THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE CROSS

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 1:17-31.

Learn by Heart: “The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God”. 1 Corinthians 1:18.

To the world, the Cross is weakness. Why would anyone worship a crucified man? In the Roman society, crucifixion was the lowest form of shame—a criminal’s death. Yet, Paul declares that what looks like foolishness to humans is the very power of God. The Gospel reverses human logic. We expect strength, glory, and triumph. Instead, God revealed salvation through suffering, shame, and sacrifice. This is why many reject the message. It offends human pride. But for those who believe, the Cross is the doorway to life.

The Cross shows us God’s wisdom. It silences our boasting, reminding us that salvation is not earned by intellect, morality, or human achievement. It is a gift of Grace. Through the Cross, God reconciles sinners, breaks the power of death, and offers eternal hope. For us today, the temptation is still to seek worldly wisdom and strength. We want polished appearances, persuasive arguments and impressive credentials. But Paul insists that our hope rests not in human ability, but in Christ, crucified. The power of the Gospel is not in presentation, but in transformation.

Challenge: Do not be ashamed of the Cross. Embrace its “foolishness” and proclaim it boldly. 

Prayer: Father, when others dismiss the foolishness of the Cross, please help me to embrace it.


LESSON 4:				BOAST IN THE LORD

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 1:27-31.

Learn by Heart: “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord”, 
1 Corinthians 1:31.

The Corinthians prided themselves in wisdom, eloquence, and leaders. But Paul redirects their boasting: all glory belongs to the Lord. Human achievement fades, but God’s work endures. Boasting in the Lord means acknowledging that every gift, talent, and success comes from Him. It shifts the focus from self to Saviour. Our worth is not in accomplishments, but in Christ alone.

The Cross destroys human pride. Salvation is by Grace, not merit. Therefore, the only appropriate boast is in what God has done for us in Christ. For us, today, the temptation to boast remains, whether in possessions, status, or abilities. But Paul reminds us: our confidence must rest in Christ alone. He is our wisdom, righteousness, and redemption.

Challenge: Examine what you boast about. Shift your focus from self to Christ. 

Prayer: Father, help me to boast only in You, declaring Your glory.



LESSON 5:				GOD’S WISDOM, NOT OURS

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 2:1-7.

Learn by Heart: “So that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power”, 1 Corinthians 2:5.

The Corinthians prized eloquence and philosophy, yet Paul preached simply Christ crucified. He wanted their faith to rest, not on clever words, but on God’s power. Human wisdom is limited. It changes with culture and fades with time. God’s wisdom is eternal, unchanging, and revealed through the Spirit. The Cross itself looked foolish to the world, but it is the ultimate wisdom of God.

This challenges us today. We are tempted to rely on intellect, strategies, and human strength. Yet, true faith must rest on God’s power alone. Only His wisdom brings salvation, sustains hope, and transforms lives. When we lean on God’s wisdom, we walk in humility, knowing our strength is insufficient. The Spirit leads us into truth, and the Word guides our steps.

Challenge: Trust God’s wisdom over human reasoning. In decisions, seek His Word and Spirit before leaning on personal logic. 

Prayer: Father, help me to build my faith on Christ’s power, not human ideas.




LESSON 6:			BUILDING ON THE RIGHT FOUNDATION

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 3:9-15.

Learn by Heart: “For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ”, 1 Corinthians 3:11.

Every life is built on something, career, relationships, wealth, or reputation. But Paul warns that only one foundation lasts: Jesus Christ. Anything else is unstable and will crumble. Christ is the cornerstone of faith. He alone secures our salvation, identity, and hope. Building on Him means surrendering our lives, aligning our choices with His Word, and rooting our purpose in Him.

Paul warns that works built on faulty foundations will not endure. Fire will test them, revealing what was done for self and what was done for Christ. Only what is built on Him will remain. For us, this is a call to evaluate our lives. What are we building on? Success? Approval? Comfort? These cannot withstand trials or eternity. Only Christ is unshakable.

Challenge: Build your life on Christ alone. Examine your priorities—are they anchored in Him? 

Prayer: Father, I commit to making Jesus the center of my decisions, values, and goals.



LESSON 7:				THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 6:14-20.

Learn by Heart: “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? 1 Corinthians 6:19.

Paul reminds the Corinthians and us that our bodies are sacred spaces. The Spirit of God does not dwell in buildings of stone but in believers themselves. We are walking temples, carriers of God’s presence in the world. This truth reshapes how we view ourselves. We are not our own; we were bought at a price—the blood of Christ. Therefore, our lives, bodies, and choices belong to Him. Holiness is not merely about rituals; it is about daily surrender.

For the Corinthians, this meant rejecting immorality and idolatry that defiled the body. For us, today, it challenges how we treat ourselves and others. Every decision—what we consume, how we speak, how we relate—must reflect the Spirit dwelling within. Being God’s temple also means we portray His presence to a watching world. Wherever we go – work place, school, home, we bring the light of Christ. We are sacred vessels in ordinary settings. This dignity calls us to consciously live with reverence for God.

Challenge: Today, honour God with your body. Ask yourself: Does my lifestyle reflect the Spirit within me? 

Prayer: Father, please help me to live as a temple where God’s glory is displayed.



LESSON 8:					RUN TO WIN

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 9:20-27.

Learn by Heart: “Run in such a way as to get the prize”, 1 Corinthians 9:24.

Paul compares the Christian life to a race. In Corinth, athletic games were famous, and runners trained with discipline, focus, and sacrifice. Paul uses this image to call believers to purposeful living. Faith is not passive, it requires concerted effort. Just as athletes deny themselves for the sake of victory, we too, must lay aside distractions and sins that entangle us. Eternal reward awaits those who faithfully persevere.

But, this is not about earning salvation. It is about the joy of pleasing Christ and finishing well. Salvation is a gift, but faithful living requires commitment. Discipline in prayer, Scripture, and obedience strengthens us for the race. Unlike earthly crowns that fade, the crown Christ gives is eternal. Athletes strive for a perishable wreath; we run for an imperishable reward. This perspective gives purpose to every act of faithfulness, no matter how small.

Challenge: Run your race with focus. Do not drift aimlessly; set your eyes on Christ. 

Prayer: Father, help me to run with endurance so as to win the eternal prize in Christ.



LESSON 9:					LOVE NEVER FAILS

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 13:1-8.

Learn by Heart: “Love never fails”, 1 Corinthians 13:8.

In Corinth, spiritual gifts were prized, tongues, prophecy and knowledge. But Paul reminds them that gifts fade; love alone endures. Love is the hallmark of maturity and the heartbeat of Christian living. This love is not mere sentiment, but selfless action. It is patient, kind, humble, and enduring. It seeks others’ good above its own. While eloquence may impress and knowledge may astonish, without love they mean nothing.

Paul elevates love as the highest virtue because it reflects God Himself. “God is love,” and to love is to mirror His character. Gifts will cease when perfection comes, but love will remain forever, continuing into eternity. For us, this means love must shape every relationship and ministry. It is easy to serve for recognition or perform for applause. But love transforms service into worship. Love is what gives value to sacrifice, meaning to labor, and beauty to obedience.

Challenge: Today, choose love. In word, tone, and actions, let love lead.

Prayer: Father, let love direct and drive my life, even when it is difficult.



LESSON 10:			OUR LABOUR IN THE LORD IS NOT IN VAIN

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 15:57, 58.

Learn by Heart: “Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labour in the Lord is not in vain”, 1 Corinthians 15:58.


Paul ends his great resurrection chapter with encouragement for weary believers. Because Christ rose, our work for Him is never wasted. Even when unseen or unappreciated, God sees every act of faithfulness.
In Corinth, believers were tempted to grow weary, surrounded by opposition and hardship. Paul reminded them that the resurrection hope makes their labour meaningful. Death is defeated, so nothing done for Christ is ever in vain.

For us today, it is easy to feel unnoticed. Serving quietly, praying faithfully, or sharing the Gospel without visible results can feel discouraging. Yet God promises that no effort done in His Name is wasted. Even the smallest act of love carries eternal weight. This truth motivates us to serve with perseverance. We labour not for applause or recognition but for the glory of Christ. Because He lives, our work has eternal value.

Challenge: Keep serving faithfully. Do not grow weary in doing good. Remember, every prayer, sacrifice, and act of love matters to God. 

Prayer: Father, help me to continue labour in You oh Lord.



LESSON 11:				VICTORY OVER DEATH

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 15:51-58.

Learn by Heart: “But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ”,
1 Corinthians 15:57.

Death is humanity’s greatest enemy. It spares no one, and its sting seems final. Yet Paul triumphantly declares that, in Christ, death has been defeated. Through His resurrection, Jesus broke the power of the grave and secured eternal life for all who believe. This victory is not abstract, it is personal. The grave no longer has the last word over our lives. For the believer, death becomes not an end, but a doorway into eternal fellowship with God. Christ’s victory is our assurance of hope.

Paul’s words remind us that we do not need to live in fear. Because Jesus conquered death, we can face life with courage and even face death with peace. This truth gives us strength in grief and boldness in mission. Victory does not mean we escape suffering or mortality in this life, but it means the outcome is secure. Christ has guaranteed the final chapter, and it ends not in despair but in glory.

Challenge: Live with resurrection hope. Do not let fear of death or uncertainty about the future rob you of your joy. 

Prayer: Father, I give thanks to You that You give me daily victory in Christ. 


LESSON 12:		GOD OF ALL COMFORT

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 1:1-4.

Learn by Heart: “The God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles”, 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4.

Paul opens his letter with praise, not for ease, but for God’s comfort in suffering. God is the Father of compassion, the One who meets us in our deepest pain with His unfailing presence. Notice that God does not promise a trouble-free life. Paul himself endured persecution, shipwreck, and sorrow. Yet in every trial, God provided comfort, peace that passes understanding, strength to endure, and hope beyond despair.

This comfort is not only for us. Paul reminds us that we receive it so that we may comfort others. God’s consolation flows into us so it can flow through us. Our scars become sources of healing for others. For us, today, this means our pain counts. Even in suffering, God is at work, shaping us and equipping us to serve others with empathy and grace. Comfort received becomes comfort shared.

Challenge: Receive God’s comfort in your struggles. Let Him heal and strengthen you. Then look around for those who might need the comfort you have received.

Prayer: Father, please help me to be Your instrument of encouragement, reminding others that they are never alone.



LESSON 13:		THE VEIL REMOVED

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 3:15-18.

Learn by Heart: “But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away”, 2 Corinthians 3:16.

Paul uses the imagery of a veil to describe spiritual blindness. Just as a veil covered Moses’ face, unbelievers are veiled from seeing God’s glory in Christ. But when we turn to the Lord, the veil is lifted, and we see clearly. The Gospel opens our eyes. What once seemed confusing becomes clear. The Spirit reveals Christ, and we behold His glory. This vision transforms us, changing us from inside out.

For the Corinthians, steeped in old traditions and idolatry, this was a radical message. For us today, it is a reminder that only Christ brings clarity. Education, culture, or effort cannot remove the veil only turning to Jesus can. This transformation is ongoing. As we behold the Lord daily, we are changed “from glory to glory.” The Christian life is a journey of increasing clarity and likeness to Christ.

Challenge: Turn to the Lord continually. Ask Him to remove any veil clouding your vision—whether doubt, fear, or distraction. 

Prayer: Father, fix my eyes on Christ and let His Spirit transform me day by day.



LESSON 14:		STRENGTH IN SUFFERING

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 4:5-18.

Learn by Heart: “For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all”, 2 Corinthians 4:17.


Suffering is never easy. Yet, Paul calls our trials “light and momentary” compared to the eternal glory that awaits us. He saw that pain, though real, is temporary, while glory is everlasting. This verse gives us hope in hardship. Our struggles are not meaningless; they are producing something eternal. God uses trials to refine faith, deepen dependence, and prepare us for glory beyond imagination.

Paul’s life testifies to this truth. Shipwrecked, imprisoned, beaten, and rejected, he still called his troubles “momentary.” Why? Because his eyes were fixed not on the temporary but on eternity. This means we can endure with hope. Trials may feel crushing, but they cannot compare to the joy that awaits us in Christ. Eternity outweighs suffering.

Challenge: When hardship comes, fix your eyes on eternity. Remind yourself that pain will pass, but glory will last forever. 

Prayer: Father, let my suffering drive me closer to Christ and deepen me in anticipation of that eternal joy.



LESSON 15;		TREASURES IN JARS OF CLAY

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 4:7-11. 

Learn by Heart: “We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from God and not from us”, 2 Corinthians 4:7.

Paul describes believers as fragile clay jars carrying a priceless treasure, the Gospel of Christ. Clay jars were common, ordinary, and easily broken, yet they often held valuable contents. This image reminds us that God intentionally uses weak vessels to carry His power. Our frailty highlights His glory. The focus is not on the container, but on the treasure within.

Life often exposes our fragility. We crack under pressure, stumble in weakness, and feel unworthy. Yet God’s power shines brightest in those very moments. Our brokenness does not disqualify us—it becomes the backdrop for His strength. The Gospel’s treasure is too glorious to be explained by human ability. When the world sees ordinary people transformed by Christ, they recognize that the power is divine.

Challenge: Do not despise your weakness. Remember you are a jar of clay, but within you resides the treasure of Christ.

Prayer: Father, please help me to live by Your surpassing power, day by day, especially today.


LESSON 16:			WALK BY FAITH

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 5:6-10.

Learn by Heart: “For we live by faith, not by sight”, 2 Corinthians 5:7.

Life often tempts us to trust only what we can see. But Paul calls us to walk by faith, anchoring our lives in God’s promises, even when circumstances look uncertain. Faith is not blind optimism. It is confidence in God’s character. We may not see the full picture, but we trust the One who does. Abraham walked by faith, leaving his homeland without knowing his destination. Likewise, we are called to trust God step by step.

Walking by sight means leaning on feelings or appearances. Walking by faith means trusting God’s Word above all else. It requires surrender and patience, knowing that His timing and ways are perfect. For believers, this perspective changes everything. Trials become opportunities to trust. Uncertainty becomes a chance to deepen reliance on God. Faith steadies us when sight would make us stumble.

Challenge: Choose faith over fear today. When you cannot see the outcome, trust the One who leads the way.

Prayer: Father, help me to walk by faith and not by sight, and let Your promises guide my steps, today and every other day.



LESSON 17:			NEW CREATION

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 5:14-17.

Learn by Heart: “If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here”! 2 Corinthians 5:17.

In Christ, salvation is not a surface level improvement, but a radical transformation. We are not merely patched up; we are made new. Paul describes believers as a new creation, the old identity marked by sin and separation is gone, and a new life has begun. This transformation is both immediate and ongoing. The moment we believe, God forgives us and gives us a new nature. But day by day, He continues to shape us into the image of Christ. The past no longer defines us, the Cross does.

This truth frees us from shame and gives us a new identity rooted in Grace. We no longer live under the weight of who we were; we live in the reality of who we are becoming in Christ. For the Corinthians, surrounded by immorality, this was a powerful reminder. In our time, it is hope that our mistakes do not define our future. In Christ, we have a fresh beginning.

Challenge: Live as the new creation you are. Leave behind old patterns of sin, fear, and guilt. Embrace your new identity in Christ.

Prayer: Father, make each day an opportunity for me to walk in the newness of life that only Jesus provides.


LESSON 18:			CHRIST’S LOVE COMPELS US

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 5:13-15.

Learn by Heart: “For Christ’s love compels us”, 2 Corinthians 5:14.

Paul explains his motivation for ministry: the love of Christ. It was not duty, fear, or ambition that drove him, but the overwhelming reality of Jesus’ love. Christ’s love is both the foundation and fuel of the Christian life. His sacrifice on the Cross demonstrates love beyond measure. Once we grasp this love, it compels us to live differently—no longer for ourselves, but for Him who died for us.

This compulsion is not forced; it is joyful surrender. Love transforms duty into delight, service into worship, and sacrifice into privilege. In our day, many things compete for our motivation. But only love sustains. Fear may drive temporarily, but love endures. When Christ’s love fills our hearts, it empowers us to forgive, serve, and persevere.

Challenge: Let Christ’s love be your motivation. Before you act, ask: Am I compelled by love?

Prayer: Father, allow your love to guide my words, choices, and service always.



LESSON 19:			COMFORT IN TRIALS

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 7:1-7.

Learn by Heart: “But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us”, 2 Corinthians 7:6.

Paul experienced discouragement. Ministry was hard, and, sometimes, he felt downcast. Yet he experienced God’s comfort, sometimes directly, sometimes through the encouragement of others. God does not leave His children in despair. This verse shows the tender heart of God. He notices the brokenhearted and draws near to the weary. His comfort is personal, timely, and sufficient. Sometimes it comes through His Word, sometimes through His Spirit, and often through the care of fellow believers.

Trials are real, but so is God’s presence. He does not always remove hardship, but He always provides comfort in it. Like Paul, we may be pressed down, but we are never abandoned. Even today, discouragement is inevitable, but despair is not. God’s comfort lifts us, reminding us that He is near and faithful.

Challenge: When you are downcast, look to God for comfort. Allow His Word and His people to strengthen you.

Prayer: Father, please comfort and encourage me as the need arises, for me to be able to comfort and encourage others accordingly.
 

LESSON 20:		GOD LOVES A CHEERFUL GIVER

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 9:6-10.

Learn by Heart: “Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver”, 2 Corinthians 9:7.

Giving is not meant to be a burden, but a blessing. Paul reminds the Corinthians that generosity should flow from the heart, not from pressure or guilt. God delights in cheerful giving because it reflects His own generosity. Our giving is an act of worship. It is not about the amount but about the attitude. God Himself is the ultimate giver. He gave His Son. When we give joyfully, we reflect His character.

Cheerful giving also acknowledges that all we have belongs to God. We are stewards, not owners. Generosity is a declaration of trust, saying, “God, You are my provider, and I honor You with what I have.” Generosity is not limited to money. It includes time, service, encouragement and love. A cheerful spirit transforms ordinary acts into eternal investments.

Challenge: Give with joy. Whether through finances, service, or kindness, let your giving reflect God’s love. 

Prayer: Father, make my heart cheerful in giving, knowing that You delight in it.



LESSON 21:		GOD’S POWER IN WEAKNESS

Scripture in Focus: 2 Corinthians 12:8-10.

Learn by Heart: "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness," 2 Corinthians 12:9.

We often see weakness as failure. We hide our struggles, put on masks of strength, and strive to appear capable before others. Paul wrestled with a “thorn in the flesh” that seemed unbearable. He prayed repeatedly for God to remove it. Yet God’s answer was not deliverance but sufficiency: “My grace is enough.” This is logical, "our weaknesses are not liabilities, but opportunities for God’s power to be displayed". In human weakness, divine strength becomes visible. God’s grace is not just an abstract idea; it is an active power that sustains us in trials, lifts us in despair, and empowers us to endure.

Paul chose to boast in his weakness, not because he gloried in pain, but because it magnified Christ. The world celebrates strength, achievement, and self-reliance. The Gospel celebrates surrender, humility, and dependence on God. When we admit our weakness, Christ’s power rests upon us. This implies we do not need to pretend to be strong. We can embrace our limitations knowing they are the canvas on which God paints His glory. The very areas where we feel most inadequate can become testimonies of His sustaining grace.

Challenge: Instead of despising weakness, invite Christ into it. 

Prayer: Father, let Your strength be made perfect in me when facing trials.


LESSON 22:			A CLEAN HEART, A RENEWED SPIRIT

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 51:10–12.

Learn by Heart: "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me," Psalm 51:10 

Sin corrupts the heart and steals the joy of salvation, leaving a person spiritually weak and distant from God. David’s prayer in this psalm reveals the deep longing of a repentant soul. A clean heart is not just about being free from guilt, but about being renewed from within so that our desires, thoughts, and actions align with God’s will. Without a clean heart, worship becomes empty and service loses its fragrance before God.

Restoration begins with genuine repentance and an earnest cry for renewal. The Holy Spirit is the source of true joy and spiritual strength and, without Him, we become vulnerable to sin and spiritual dryness. Just like David, every believer must continually ask God to renew their inner man, to restore the joy of salvation, and to keep them in His presence. A renewed spirit revives our passion for prayer, worship, and holy living. Have you lost the freshness of your spiritual life? Turn to God today for cleansing and revival.

Challenge: Take time to sincerely confess any sin before God and ask Him to renew your spirit and restore your joy.

Prayer: Lord, create in me a clean heart and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Restore my joy and keep me in Your presence always.


LESSON 23:			GOD OUR REFUGE

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 52:1–9.

Learn by Heart: “But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God forever and ever,” Psalm 52:8.

Life is full of trials, uncertainties, and attacks from the enemy. In this Psalm, David reflects on the schemes of the wicked, but concludes that their boasting is short-lived, because God’s mercy endures forever. The wicked may appear to flourish for a moment, but their end is destruction. Believers, however, are encouraged to place their trust in God as their refuge. His mercy, like the deep roots of an olive tree, causes them to flourish, even in the face of adversity.

The lesson here is clear: do not envy the temporary success of the wicked. Instead, anchor your life in God’s mercy and truth. Continually dwell in His presence, delight in His Word, and remain steadfast in faith. Just as the green olive tree thrives in the House of God, so shall those who trust Him remain fresh and fruitful, bearing testimony of His goodness.

Challenge: Are you tempted to envy the fleeting success of those who do evil? Focus instead on being rooted in God’s presence and mercy.

Prayer: Lord, make me like the green olive tree in Your house. Help me to trust in Your mercy and to flourish in Your presence, regardless of the storms around me.


LESSON 24:		GOD’S UNFAILING MERCY

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 53:6.

Learn by Heart: “Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad,” Psalm 53:6.

God’s mercy remains one of the most profound attributes of His character. In this Psalm, the Psalmist looks forward to the salvation that comes from God alone. Despite the sins and shortcomings of His people, the Lord promises deliverance and restoration. This reveals that God does not deal with us according to what we deserve but according to His unfailing mercy. When we reflect on our own lives, we can see times when mercy spoke louder than judgment. His mercy forgives, restores, and gives hope, even in hopeless situations.

We must respond to this mercy with repentance, faith, and gratitude. Mercy is never a license to continue in sin, but a call to return to God. If we acknowledge our weaknesses and turn to Him, He will surely bring back our “captivity” – whatever represents bondage, sorrow, or failure in our lives. His unfailing mercy is the doorway to our rejoicing and gladness, just as Israel awaited her redemption.

Challenge: Live daily with gratitude for God’s mercy and extend that same mercy to others.

Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your unfailing mercy that restores and forgives. Help me to walk in it daily and share it with others. 


LESSON 25:			GOD IS MY HELP

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 54:1–7.

Learn by Heart: "Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul," Psalm 54:4.

Life often brings moments when we feel surrounded by challenges, whether from people who oppose us or circumstances that seem too hard to bear. In this Psalm, David cried out to God for help when he was betrayed and threatened by his enemies. Instead of taking matters into his own hands, he turned to God, knowing that only the Lord could deliver him. God is our helper in times of trouble, our strength when we are weak, and our shield when opposition rises against us.

Just as David trusted God to vindicate him, we too must rely on God for help rather than depending on human strength or retaliating in bitterness. God knows the schemes of the enemy and will deal with them justly. When we commit our challenges to Him, He will sustain us and give us peace. Whatever the battle you face today—be it spiritual, emotional, or physical—remember that the Lord is your helper and He will not abandon you.

Challenge: Will you trust God as your helper in this present challenge, or will you fight in your own strength?

Prayer: Lord, I thank You for being my helper and sustainer. Fight my battles and let my life continually be a testimony of Your faithfulness.


LESSON 26:		WALKING IN INTEGRITY

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 101:2.

Learn by Heart: "He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known," Proverbs 10:9. 

Integrity is the foundation of lasting greatness. David, the Psalmist, understood that walking uprightly begins not in the public eye, but within one’s house—with a perfect heart before God. When a person’s private life aligns with their public confession, heaven releases favour. As Billy Graham once said, "Integrity means doing the right thing even when no one is watching." This truth calls believers to a higher standard, one that invites divine presence and favour into their homes and ministries.

Lack of integrity opens the door for distrust, division, and spiritual decay, while integrity builds a legacy that outlives us. History records that men and women who walked uprightly, though faced with trials, were upheld by God. Consider Daniel—his unwavering stand in Babylon distinguished him in a corrupt empire. Your integrity is not just about your reputation; it is about your relationship with God. When the heart is pure and motives are sincere, God Himself becomes your defense and reward.

Challenge: Are you the same person in private as you are in public? Will your children, colleagues, and heaven testify that your life is transparent before God?

Prayer: Lord, help me to walk in integrity of heart and action. Purify my motives and let my secret life bring glory to Your name.



LESSON 27:			FAITH THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS

Scripture Focus:  Psalm 37:5.

Learn by Heart: “Commit your way to the Lord,”  Psalm 37:5

Faith is the bridge between your current situation and your desired future in God. When you commit your ways to Him, you release control and invite divine intervention. Many times, our human reasoning wants to calculate how God will act, but true faith simply trusts His timing and method. As Charles Spurgeon wisely said, “Faith goes up the stairs that love has built and looks out the windows which hope has opened.” Faith is not passive; it is active trust-waiting, believing, and moving as God leads.

Consider a farmer who plants a seed: he does not keep digging it up to check if it grows, he simply waters and waits. Likewise, when we present our challenges, plans, or burdens to God, we must leave them at His feet and act in faith. The Psalmist encourages us to roll our way upon the Lord-our decisions, fears, and hopes-and then stand firm in expectation. Faith is not the absence of challenges; it is the presence of unwavering confidence in God’s ability to turn them into testimonies.

Challenge: What are you still holding back from God’s control? Release it to Him in prayer and trust Him to perfect it in His time.

Prayer: Lord, I release my plans, struggles, and desires into Your hands. Help me to trust You without wavering and to walk boldly in faith. 


LESSON 28:		STANDING WITH THE LORD IS TRUE PROTECTION

Scripture Focus: Psalm 91:1.

Learn by Heart: "He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty," Psalm 91:1.

Today’s world is full of danger and uncertainties; but true safety is not found in walls we build or gates we buy. It is found in the Lord. There was once a lawyer who used to drive to work on the same route daily. One morning, he decided to take another route because of a traffic report on his usual way, not knowing that a fatal accident occurred on that very road moments after he passed it. He later testified saying, “I know it was the morning prayers I prayed that directed my path.”

When we stand with the Lord, His protection surrounds us. A wise saying goes, “The protection of men may fail, but the protection of God stands forever.” Earthly security is limited, but the shelter of God has no time limit. Let us remember that true protection lies in daily faithfulness and trust in God.

Challenge: Are you dwelling under the Shadow of the Lord daily, or are you depending on human security?

Prayer: Lord, keep me daily in Your secret place and let no evil befall me.


LESSON 29:		PEACE IN THE MIDST OF CHAOS

Scripture Focus: Psalm 85:8.

Learn by Heart: “I will listen to what God the Lord says; he promises peace to his people, his faithful servants-but let them not turn to folly,” Psalm 85:8.


Peace is not the absence of trouble; it is the presence of God in the midst of it. The Psalmist declares his intention to listen to the Lord, knowing that His Word brings calm even when storms rage around. A renowned Christian author once said, “True peace comes not from the absence of storms, but from the assurance that God is in the boat with you.”

Consider the story of a farmer who hung a sign outside his farm saying: “I can sleep when the wind blows.” People wondered what it meant until a great storm came one night. While others panicked, he slept peacefully, because he had prepared-secured his farm, stored his tools and trusted the process. His peace came from readiness and trust. In the same way, God calls us to cultivate peace by trusting His promises, preparing our hearts, and refusing to be shaken by the chaos of the world.

Challenge: Will you choose to trust God’s promises of peace today even when your surroundings suggest otherwise? Identify one area of unrest in your life and surrender it to Him in faith.

Prayer: Lord, grant me Your peace that surpasses all understanding. Help me to listen to Your Word and rest in the assurance of Your promises, no matter the chaos around me.


LESSON 30:		THE BEAUTY OF FRUITFULNESS

Scripture Focus: Psalm 92:12.
 
Learn by Heart: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon,” Psalm 92:12.

Fruitfulness is more than physical increase; it is the expression of a life that reflects God's purpose in every season. The palm tree is known for its ability to remain green, strong, and productive even in harsh conditions. Likewise, the righteous flourish because their roots draw nourishment from the living God. A wise saying goes, “A tree is not remembered for its height but for the fruit it bears.” When your life is rooted in Christ, your character, your words, and your deeds become fruits that bless others and glorify God.

Fruitfulness also speaks of continuity and impact beyond oneself. Just as a fruitful tree provides shade, food, and shelter for generations, your fruitfulness should nourish lives around you. There is a story of a farmer who planted two trees—one by the riverside and another on dry ground. The one by the river thrived, bore fruit abundantly, and became a refuge for birds and travelers, while the other withered because it lacked supply. Where your roots are planted will determine the fruits you bear. Stay connected to the source—Jesus Christ—and your life will remain productive, regardless of seasons.

Challenge: Are your roots deep in God or in self-dependence? Choose today to stay planted by the rivers of living water.

Prayer: Lord, establish my roots in You. Make me fruitful in every season and a blessing to my generation. 



LESSON 31:		THE POWER OF PRAISE AND WORSHIP

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 95:1–2.

Learn by Heart: “Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms,”  Psalm 95:2.

Praise and worship are not musical interludes; they are faith’s bold confession that God is greater than what confronts us. Psalm 95:1–2 invites us to come singing, thankful, and loud with holy joy because worship re-centers our hearts on the Rock of our salvation. As Archbishop William Temple observed, “Worship is the submission of all our nature to God.” When our minds, emotions, and wills bow, God’s greatness fills our small spaces-worry shrinks, courage rises, and hope returns. Worship is more than sound; it is surrender.

A small church once lost power supply five minutes before service. The worship leader lit a single lantern, asked the congregation to sit close, and started a simple chorus. Within moments, anxious whispers turned into steady voices; tears replaced tension. When the lights finally came back, no one noticed-they were already standing in a brighter light. That evening, nothing in town had changed, but something in their hearts had: praise had re-ordered their view of God and their problems. When life “goes dark,” step toward God with songs, gratitude, and yieldedness. In His presence, heaviness lifts and strength returns.

Challenge: Begin and end today with five minutes of wholehearted praise. Name three reasons God is worthy-then sing them to Him.

Prayer: Lord, teach me to worship with a surrendered heart. As I praise You, let Your presence lift my burdens and renew my strength.

LESSON 1:				FAVOUR WITH GOD AND PEOPLE

Scripture  in Focus: Psalm 84:11.

Learn by Heart: “For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,” Psalm 84:11.

True favour with God and human is not achieved by manipulation or worldly influence, but by walking uprightly before the Lord. The Psalmist reminds us that God Himself is our “sun and shield,” meaning He gives light for direction and protection in our journey. When God’s favour rests on a man, doors open even in unlikely places, relationships flourish beyond natural ability, and resources find their way to fulfill divine purposes. A witty saying declares, “Divine favour turns struggles into steps and obstacles into opportunities.” Therefore, cultivating a life of obedience, integrity, and humility is the key that draws this heavenly favour.

Moreover, divine favour often overflows into human favour. Joseph found favor in the eyes of Potiphar and Pharaoh because God was with him (Genesis 39:2–4, 41:39–41). When you walk in alignment with God, men are stirred to support, recommend and even defend you. This favour is not for selfish gain, but for kingdom advancement and to bless others. Seek to please God first, and He will cause people to honor you, even in places where you are least expected to succeed.

Challenge: What deliberate steps will you take this week to walk uprightly so that God’s favour can manifest in every area of your life?

Prayer: Lord, let Your favour surround me as a shield. Cause me to walk uprightly and open doors of grace and honor that no man can shut.


LESSON 2: 			DIVINE MERCY IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 57:1. 

Learn by Heart: “For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee,” Psalm 86:5.

Divine mercy is God’s compassionate intervention in the midst of our afflictions. The Psalmist, in his moments of distress, often cried to God for mercy, not on the basis of his righteousness, but because he understood that God’s mercy prevails over judgment (Psalm 103:8-10). When life presents storms and challenges, we must remember that mercy is not earned; it is requested and received through humble supplication. Just as a river refreshes a dry land, God’s mercy flows to quench the thirst of a troubled soul. One wise saying reminds us, “Mercy is the bridge that carries the weak over the floods of life’s troubles.”
	
In times of trouble, divine mercy turns captivity into testimony and fear into faith. David, though pursued and afflicted, trusted in the wings of God’s mercy as a safe refuge (Psalm 57:1). This teaches us that no pit is too deep for God’s mercy to reach, and no storm too fierce for His compassion to calm. Believers must learn to approach God with a contrite heart, for “the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart” (Psalm 34:18). When mercy speaks, judgment is silenced, doors of restoration are opened, and God’s favour becomes a shield.

Challenge: Will you daily call upon the mercy of God, not only for yourself but also for your family and nation, trusting that His compassion never fails?

Prayer: Merciful Father, overshadow me with Your mercy in times of trouble, turn my captivity to testimonies, and let Your loving-kindness never depart from my household.



LESSON 3:			WALKING IN HOLY FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 63:8. 

Learn by Heart: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant,” Psalm 25:14.

Walking in holy fellowship with God is a daily pursuit that demands devotion, obedience, and intentional closeness. David declared, “My soul followeth hard after thee,” showing us that true fellowship is an active chase, not a casual drift. A wise saying reminds us: “Fellowship without consistency is like a branch cut off from the tree—it soon withers.” A gardener once tended his flourishing garden faithfully, watering it daily. One morning, he found a branch withered and lifeless. On inspection, he discovered it had broken away from the stem days before, losing its source of life. In the same way, when believers neglect fellowship with God, spiritual dryness creeps in, and mercy seems far away. But when restored to His presence, His mercy flows like a river, refreshing every dry and weary soul.

This fellowship is more than a religious routine; it is the secret place where mercy shields us, strength is renewed, and divine guidance flows without hindrance. Those who daily seek God’s face through prayer, His Word, and humble obedience find that His right hand upholds them in times of weakness, His mercy covers their families, and His covenant blessings remain intact. Fellowship attracts His presence, and His presence turns confusion to clarity, battles to victories, and weakness to strength.

Challenge: Will you press daily into the fellowship of God—through prayer, His Word, and obedience—so that your life remains rooted in His mercy and strength?

Prayer: Lord, draw me closer into daily fellowship with You. Let my soul cleave unto You without wavering.


LESSON 4:				LIVING A LIFE OF INTEGRITY

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 86:11.  

Learn by Heart: ”Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name”, Psalms 86:11.  

Integrity is like a solid foundation for a house-without it, even the most beautiful structure will collapse. Psalm 15 paints a picture of the person who will dwell in God's presence: one who walks blamelessly, does what is right, and speaks the truth from the heart. In a world where shortcuts, deception, and compromise seem to yield faster results, integrity remains the rare but priceless path that pleases God.

A Yoruba proverb says, “Character is beauty”. No amount of wealth, title, or position can replace a life of uprightness. There was once a wealthy merchant who lost all his possessions, but because his name was known for honesty and trustworthiness, people quickly rallied around to help him rebuild. Integrity opens doors that riches cannot. God desires that His children reflect His nature of truth and uprightness in every area—business, family, ministry, and relationships. When we choose integrity, even in the smallest matters, we position ourselves to enjoy His abiding presence and favour.

Challenge: Are there areas of your life where compromise has slowly crept in? Today, make a decision to realign with God's standard of truth. Let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no (Matthew 5:37).

Prayer: Lord, give me a heart that delights in truth and a life that reflects Your holiness, so I may dwell in Your presence always.


LESSON 5:			THE POWER OF GOD’S PRESENCE

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 91:1-2.

Learn by Heart: “I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust”, Psalm 91:2.

God’s presence is not a place we visit occasionally; it is a life we choose daily. To “dwell” in the secret place means unhurried communion—prayer that lingers, obedience that lasts, and worship that fills ordinary moments. When we abide, fear shrinks, clarity grows, and courage returns. A seasoned elder once said, “The safest place on earth is not behind walls of stone, but beneath the shadow of the Almighty.” That shadow is near to those who stay near. We do not earn this nearness; we welcome it—by opening Scriptures with a listening heart, by ordering our steps in holiness, and by whispering trust when headlines shout trouble.

A brief story: A young nurse dreaded the graveyard shift during a citywide blackout. Remembering Psalm 91, she quietly prayed over each ward, repeating, “My God; in him will I trust.” Power flickered, alarms blared, yet a strange calm settled. Later her supervisor remarked, “You were steady when everything shook.” She smiled: it wasn’t her composure; it was the Presence she experienced. Wisdom says, “Where God is welcomed, storms find their boundary.” The presence of God may not remove every danger, but it redefines the atmosphere—turning panic into peace, confusion into guidance, and loneliness into companionship. Choose to dwell, not dip in; to remain, not rush out. Those who abide become unshakable, because they lean on the Unshakeable One.

Challenge: Establish a “dwelling rhythm” today: 10 quiet minutes in the Word and prayer morning and night. Guard it like an appointment with the King.

Prayer: Lord, draw me to Your secret place. Teach me to abide, not visit— to trust You as my refuge and fortress. 


LESSON 6:   			GOD’S GREAT POWER TOWARDS ALL THAT BELIEVE
	
Scripture Focus: Ephesians 1:19.

Learn by Heart: “Ye are God’s little Children, and have overcome them, greater is He that is in you, than that is in the world”. 1 John 4:4.

Believers in Christ, possess the power of God’s power to live above sin through the righteousness of Christ (II Corinthians 5:21). Power to do exploits for God through the anointing of Holy Spirit, (Acts 1:8; 10:38, John 14:12) and the power to do exploit for God through winning souls for Christ with the help of Holy Spirit. God’s great power in us gives us victory over the power of darkness. Christians you must realize that the possess God’s great power that will help them to fulfill destiny and live for God.

Many believers live below their spiritual potential, not because God is weak, but because they are unaware of the power available to them, according to Ephesians 1:19. Paul reveals that God’s power is not just great but exceedingly great. This same power has exalted Christ above all principalities and put all things under His feet. With such awesome power at your disposal, defeat and limitation have no place in your life.

Challenge: Continually access Christ’s resurrection power. This power will strengthen, transform, deliver and empower you to do exploits for God

Prayer: Lord, open my eyes to the exceeding greatness of your power working in me. Help to walk daily in faith, boldness and victory.


LESSON 7:				I WILL NOT FEAR

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 56:3, 4.

Learn by Heart: “The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?” Psalm 118:6.

Fear often begins with "I"-I’m not enough, I don’t know what to do, I’m afraid of the outcome. But when “I” turns its gaze to God, fear begins to fade. The Psalmist didn’t deny fear; he defeated it by trusting in God. Saying “I will not fear” is not a denial of reality—it’s a declaration of faith. It’s choosing to stand on the truth of God’s presence rather than the threats around you. Fear paralyzes, but faith mobilizes. When the “I” surrenders to the greatness of God, fear loses its grip.

Martin Luther once declared, “I have held many things in my hands, and I have lost them all; but whatever I have placed in God’s hands, which I still possess.” Fear comes from thinking everything rests on you. Freedom comes from realizing everything rests on God. As a child of God, you are not walking through life alone. He is with you in the fire, the flood, and the furnace. The “I” that trusts God can boldly say, “I will not fear,” because the Lord has already gone ahead.

Challenge: Speak “I will not fear” aloud today in the face of any challenge and believe God is with you.

Prayer: Lord, I cast out fear today, for I know You are near and I trust You completely.


LESSON 8:			I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED

Scripture in Focus: 2 Timothy 1:12.

Learn by Heart: “They that know thy name will put their trust in thee,” Psalm 9:10a.

Confidence in life doesn't come from knowing what’s next—it comes from knowing Who holds what’s next. Paul was in chains when he wrote these words, yet he didn’t say “I know what will happen,” but “I know whom I have believed.” His assurance wasn’t tied to circumstances, but to Christ. Knowing God is not mere head knowledge; it is born out of fellowship, experience, and surrender. The “I” that truly knows Him becomes unshakable, even when everything else is unstable.

Theologian J.I. Packer said, “A little knowledge of God is worth more than a great deal of knowledge about Him.” Many people trust God with eternity but struggle to trust Him with today. But the more we know Him, the more persuaded we become—He is able, faithful, and never fails. The “I” that is rooted in Christ’s reliability can walk through uncertain times with steady peace. You may not know how, when, or why—but you know Who. And that’s enough.

Challenge: Remind yourself today: “I may not understand everything, but I know my God is faithful.”

Prayer: Lord, I know You, and I trust You—I am fully persuaded You will keep what I’ve placed in Your hands.


LESSON 9:			I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 121:1–2.

Learn by Heart: “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith…,”  Hebrews 12:2a.

Life can press down so heavily that our eyes instinctively drop in defeat. But the Psalmist gives us a choice: “I will lift up mine eyes…” It’s a decision to redirect focus from the problem to the Person of our help. The “I” here is not looking for human solutions in high places but trusting in the Most High. He reminds himself that the One who made the heavens and the earth is the same One who will step into his need. Lifting our eyes is a spiritual act—it lifts our heart as well.

Every burden feels heavier when our gaze is on the ground. But when we look up, we gain perspective, strength, and hope. The same God who watches over the mountains watches over you. His help is not delayed, distracted, or distant. He is near. The “I” that chooses to lift its eyes is the “I” that receives fresh strength. Look to the hills—not for your rescue, but for the reminder that the Rescuer reigns above every circumstance.

Challenge: Lift your heart and eyes today—choose to see God above the situation.

Prayer: Lord, I lift my eyes to You; You are my help, and I trust You completely.


LESSON 10:				I PRESS TOWARD THE MARK

Scripture in Focus: Philippians 3:13–14.

Learn by Heart: “Let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not,” Galatians 6:9.

The journey of faith is not a stroll—it is a press. Paul, even after years of ministry and revelation, humbly confessed, “I count not myself to have apprehended.” The “I” that walks with God must remain hungry, humble, and hopeful. There’s always more in Christ. Yesterday’s achievements, failures, and delays must not hold us back. The pressing “I” chooses focus over distraction, direction over detour, and destiny over discouragement. It reaches forward with determination, not relying on strength but grace.

To press is to resist resistance. Life will offer every reason to give up—fatigue, failure, fear—but the “I” that is grounded in Christ pushes forward because of the prize ahead. And what is the prize? It’s not applause, position, or perfection. It’s Christ Himself—the high calling that makes every hardship worth it. Keep pressing. Not because you're strong, but because God is faithful. The mark is before you, and Grace is beside you. The pressing “I” will finish well.

Challenge: Push forward today—refuse to let anything behind you stop what lies ahead.

Prayer: Lord, I press on by Your grace until I fully lay hold of all You’ve called me to.


LESSON 11:		JOHN THE BAPTIST – THE VOICE OF THE FORERUNNER

Scripture in Focus: John 1:19–34; Luke 1:13–17.

Learn by Heart: “He must increase, but I must decrease,” John 3:30.

Before Jesus called His twelve, there was one who went ahead to prepare the way—John the Baptist. Born with a prophetic purpose, his voice echoed in the wilderness, not seeking fame but preparing hearts. He preached repentance, baptized multitudes, and pointed the world to the Lamb of God. John had every reason to build a following for himself, yet when Christ appeared, he stepped back so that Jesus could be seen. That is the spirit of a true disciple—one who leads people not to himself, but to the Master.

Jesus said of John, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater…” (Matthew 11:11). Not because John did miracles or written Scriptures, but because he faithfully fulfilled his assignment without compromise. His boldness, humility, and loyalty to truth cost him his life, but secured him a lasting legacy. In every generation, God still looks for men and women with the heart of John—fearless, pure, and surrendered.

Challenge: Let your life and voice point others to Jesus, not yourself.

Prayer: Lord, make me a vessel that prepares the way for Your glory in every heart I reach.


LESSON 12:				CHOSEN AND CALLED

Scripture in Focus: Luke 6:12–16; John 15:16.

Learn by Heart: “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit,” John 15:16.

The story of the twelve disciples is not just a list of names—it is a revelation of divine choice, purpose, and grace. These twelve men were not perfect, nor were they picked for their power, wealth, or influence. They were ordinary, flawed, and sometimes fearful. Yet, Jesus called them, walked with them, taught them, and ultimately sent them into the world to shake nations. Their journey is proof that when God chooses a person, He equips them beyond their weakness and reshapes their story for His glory.

Before we dive into the lives of these disciples, let us pause to remember that God is still calling disciples today. This is not just their story—it is also yours. As we learn from each man’s life, from Peter’s boldness to Judas’ betrayal, we are invited to reflect on our own walk with Christ. What kind of disciple am I becoming? Am I following closely, or from a distance? You are not just reading about them—you are being called to walk like them.

Challenge: As you begin this journey, open your heart to be taught, corrected, and transformed by Jesus.

Prayer: Lord, prepare my heart to follow You more deeply as I learn from those You first called.


LESSON 13:			PETER – FROM FAILURE TO FOUNDATION

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 16:15–19, Luke 22:32.

Learn by Heart: “And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church...,” Matthew 16:18.

Peter, originally called Simon, was bold, impulsive, and quick to speak. He denied Jesus three times, yet Jesus still chose him to preach at Pentecost. His journey is one of transformation—from a fisherman full of fear to a foundational apostle full of fire. The 'I will build My church' statement was not based on Peter’s perfection, but on his surrender and faith in Christ. Christ took Peter's weakness and made him strong through grace. Your worst failure can become the foundation for your greatest usefulness if placed in God’s hands.

Peter teaches us that no failure is final when Jesus is involved. Restoration is God’s specialty. When we weep over our wrongs, He writes a new story. Peter didn’t remain broken. He rose up because he remembered the words of Jesus-words that had already predicted his restoration (Luke 22:32). Like Peter, you, too, can be restored and recommissioned. God isn’t looking for perfection, but for willing hearts.

Challenge: Reflect on a past failure and offer it to Jesus for transformation.

Prayer: Lord, help me rise from my failures and become who You’ve called me to be.


LESSON 14:		JAMES (SON OF ZEBEDEE) – PASSION REDIRECTED

Scripture in Focus: Mark 3:17; Luke 9:54–55.

Learn by Heart: “Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord”, Romans 12:11.

James, the elder brother of John, was fiery and zealous. He once asked Jesus if they could call down fire on a Samaritan village for rejecting Him. Yet Jesus rebuked him, not because of his passion, but because of its direction. James shows us that passion without purpose can be destructive, but when redirected by Christ, it becomes a weapon for good. He was the first apostle to be martyred, not for violence, but for love and loyalty to Jesus.

God doesn’t extinguish zeal; He refines it. James went from thunderous reactions to courageous convictions. His zeal eventually became a holy fire, not a consuming flame. The Lord is seeking passionate people - ones who are willing to be disciplined, directed, and dependent on Him. What could your zeal accomplish when laid at the feet of Jesus?

Challenge: Ask God today to purify and redirect any misused passion in your life.

Prayer: Lord, channel my passion into service that honours You and blesses others.


LESSON 15:			JOHN – THE DISCIPLE OF LOVE

Scripture in Focus: John 13:23; 1 John 4:7, 8.

Learn by Heart: “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another”, John 13:34.

John was known as “the disciple whom Jesus loved.” Yet, he didn’t start off gentle. Alongside his brother James, he too was called a “son of thunder.” But time with Jesus transformed him into the apostle of love. The man once ready to call fire from heaven later wrote, “Beloved, let us love one another.” John’s life reminds us that the more we abide in Christ, the more we reflect His heart.

True love is not sentiment but surrender. John’s intimacy with Christ shaped his message. He didn’t just teach love—he lived it. From being the closest to Jesus at the Last Supper to caring for Mary at the cross, John’s actions proved his transformation. The fruit of love grows best in a heart that stays close to Jesus. So, as followers of Christ, just like John, let us obey the command; “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another”, John 13:34.

Challenge: Express Christlike love to someone who needs it today.

Prayer: Lord, help me to live as a reflection of Your love and compassion.


LESSON 16:			ANDREW – THE SILENT SOUL-WINNER

Scripture in Focus: John 1:40-42; John 6:8, 9.

Learn by Heart: "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise,” Proverbs 11:30.

Andrew may not have been as vocal or prominent as his brother Peter, but he was instrumental in introducing others to Jesus. He quietly brought Peter to Christ, and later, he brought the boy with five loaves and two fishes to Jesus before the miracle of feeding the five thousand. Andrew reminds us that you don’t have to be on the stage to be significant. God sees and rewards even the quiet acts of faithful obedience.

Though Scripture records no great sermon by Andrew, his soul-winning heart speaks volumes. While others sought crowds, Andrew sought individuals. His legacy teaches us that personal evangelism is just as powerful as public ministry. The one person you lead to Jesus today may become the one who impacts nations tomorrow. Never underestimate the eternal value of simply saying, “Come and see.”

Challenge: Share Jesus with someone in your circle this week.

Prayer: Lord, make me sensitive and willing to bring others to You today.


LESSON 17:			PHILIP – THE QUESTIONING BELIEVER

Scripture in Focus: John 1:43–46; John 14:8–9.

Learn by Heart: “If any of you lack wisdom, let him asks of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him,” James 1:5.

Philip was a disciple who often needed clarity before commitment. He questioned Jesus during the feeding of the 5,000 and later asked Jesus to “show us the Father.” Though his faith was slower, Jesus never rejected him. Instead, He patiently revealed Himself. Philip represents the sincere seeker—the one who believes, but still asks questions. God welcomes our honest doubts, if they drive us closer to Him.

Jesus did not scold Philip for his questions but gave him answers that revealed deeper truths. Christ doesn’t expect blind faith, but a faith that grows through revelation. Philip’s desire to understand led him to remain close to Jesus and, in time, he, too became a preacher of the Gospel. Don’t let your questions distance you from Christ—let them deepen your pursuit of Him.

Challenge: Bring your questions to God today instead of running from them. Attend Bible Studies. Grow in Faith.

Prayer: Lord, increase my understanding and strengthen my faith as I seek You.


LESSON 18:		BARTHOLOMEW (NATHANAEL) – A HEART WITHOUT GUILE

Scripture in Focus: John 1:45–49.

Learn by Heart: “He that hath clean hands and a pure heart… He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation,” Psalm 24:4, 5.

Bartholomew, also known as Nathanael, was introduced to Jesus by Philip. When Jesus saw him coming, He declared that Bartholomew had no deceit in him—a rare compliment from the Savior Himself. His transparency and sincerity made him stand out. He may not have been loud or visible in ministry, but he possessed what many lack: inner purity. God values integrity over popularity, and Bartholomew’s life reminds us that the quiet purity of heart matters in heaven.

One early church historian, Eusebius, wrote that Bartholomew later carried the Gospel as far as India, and, perhaps, even Armenia. Though largely behind the scenes, his influence was significant. Holiness and honesty are often underrated, but they qualify a man for divine trust. Jesus saw in him what others may have missed-a heart truly seeking God. True spirituality is not just in what we do publicly, but who we are privately.

Challenge: Ask God to purify your motives and give you a sincere heart.

Prayer: Lord, make me a person of truth with no hidden deceit in my life.


LESSON 19:		MATTHEW – FROM TAX COLLECTOR TO GOSPEL WRITER

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 9:9–13.

Learn by Heart: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new,” 2 Corinthians 5:17.

Matthew was a publican-considered a traitor and sinner by the Jews for collecting taxes for Rome. Yet Jesus called him, not despite his past, but because of His future. Without argument, Matthew arose and followed. The transformation was so complete that he would later pen the first Gospel in the New Testament. This shows us that God doesn’t just change our story; He lets us write part of His.

As D.L. Moody once said, “God never made a promise that was too good to be true.” Matthew’s calling proves that no one is too lost for Grace. Jesus didn’t ask Matthew to fix his life first—He simply said, “Follow Me.” When we do, He does the cleansing, restoring, and sending. If God could turn a despised tax collector into a Gospel scribe, He can do wonders through you.

Challenge: Don’t let your past define your future—follow Jesus fully today.

Prayer: Lord, rewrite my story and use my life as a testimony of Grace.


LESSON 20:			THOMAS – FAITH BEYOND DOUBT

Scripture in Focus: John 20:24–29.

Learn by Heart: “Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed,” John 20:29.

Thomas is often remembered as “Doubting Thomas,” but that label doesn’t fully define him. His questions came from a desire for truth, not rebellion. When he finally saw the risen Christ, he made one of the strongest declarations of faith in Scripture: “My Lord and my God.” His story teaches us that sincere doubt, when laid before Jesus, can lead to deeper conviction and stronger faith. He did not doubt the Risen Lord, he only want the confirmation. Today, his question then, happens to be one of the evidences to prove that Christ truly resurrected.

History tells us that Thomas later traveled as far as India, boldly proclaiming the Gospel and even dying as a martyr. The man once unsure became a fearless witness. Your moments of doubt don’t disqualify you—they can deepen your dependence on Christ. Thomas shows that those who struggle honestly can also stand firmly when they encounter the truth.

Challenge: Turn your doubts into prayers and let Jesus meet you there.

Prayer: Lord, even in my moments of uncertainty, help me trust You more.


LESSON 21;			JAMES (SON OF ALPHAEUS) – THE QUIET STRENGTH

Scripture in Focus: Mark 3:18; Acts 1:13.

Learn by Heart: “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord,” 1Corinthians 15:58.

James, the son of Alphaeus, is one of the least recorded among the disciples. Sometimes called "James the Less," not because he was of less value, but, perhaps, due to age, stature, or prominence. Yet his presence on the list of apostles proves that God notices the ones the world overlooks. Not every disciple preaches to crowds; some serve faithfully in the background where consistency, not applause, is what matters.

We may never read a sermon he preached or a miracle he performed, but James remained with the apostles until the end. In a world that craves recognition, James teaches us that quiet commitment counts. Faithfulness without fanfare is still precious to God. When your name is written in heaven, it doesn’t matter how often it is mentioned on earth.

Challenge: Stay consistent in your devotion even when no one sees.

Prayer: Lord, help me to be faithful in the small things and steadfast in service.



LESSON 22:			THADDAEUS – THE VOICE BEHIND THE QUESTION

Scripture in Focus: John 14:21–23.

Learn by Heart: “Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not,” Jeremiah 33:3.

Thaddaeus, also called Judas (not Iscariot), asked one of the most heartfelt questions during the Last Supper: “Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?” (John 14:22). That single question drew out one of Jesus’ most profound promises about divine presence and love. Though we don’t hear much from Thaddaeus elsewhere, his honest curiosity invited deeper revelation—a reminder that sincere questions unlock spiritual insight.

Thaddaeus teaches us that you don’t have to say much to make a difference. His one recorded question brought clarity to all who seek Christ’s presence. God doesn’t only use the loud or the seen—He values the thoughtful and the sincere. When your heart longs for more of Him, even a single question can bring you into closer communion with His truth.

Challenge: Ask God today to manifest more of Himself in your life.

Prayer: Father Lord, reveal Yourself more deeply to my heart each day.


LESSON23:			SIMON THE ZEALOT – ZEAL REDIRECTED

Scripture in Focus: Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13.

Learn by Heart: “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice,” Romans 12:1.

Simon the Zealot was once part of a radical Jewish group that opposed Roman rule, known for their intense political fervor. Yet, Jesus called him—not to destroy Rome, but to help build the Kingdom of God. Simon’s transformation is a testimony to how Jesus doesn’t quench zeal but redirects it toward eternal purposes. From a fighter for a political cause, he became a labourer for a spiritual kingdom.

Matthew Henry once noted, “Christ chooses disciples not for what they are, but for what He will make of them.” Simon’s past didn’t disqualify him—it became a platform for passionate discipleship. When our natural passions are surrendered, God redirects them for divine impact. Your zeal, when yielded to Christ, can become a fire that builds rather than burns.

Challenge: Submit your passions to God and let Him channel them for His glory.

Prayer: Lord, take every zeal in me and direct it into Your eternal purpose.


LESSON 24:		JUDAS ISCARIOT – THE TRAGEDY OF WASTED OPPORTUNITY

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 26:14–25; John 13:21–30.

Learn by Heart: “The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!” Mark 14:21.

Judas Iscariot walked with Jesus, witnessed His miracles, heard His teachings, and even participated in ministry—yet he betrayed the Master. His story is a chilling reminder that proximity to Jesus is not the same as intimacy with Him. He chose silver over the Savior and ended up in despair. The real tragedy wasn’t just his betrayal—but his refusal to repent when grace still stood within reach.

As A.W. Pink rightly stated, “It is not how close you come to Christ that saves, but whether you come all the way and surrender.” Judas was trusted with the money bag but never gave Jesus his heart. He serves as a warning to all who play religion but deny relationship. God desires loyalty from within, not outward form. Let Judas’ fall stir your heart to deeper sincerity and surrender. Don’t waste the opportunity given to you to know Christ and be saved from eternal damnation.

Challenge: Examine your heart—are you following Jesus fully or holding back?

Prayer: Lord, keep me from the trap of empty religion and draw me into true devotion.


LESSON 25;			MATTHIAS – CHOSEN BY HEAVEN’S VOTE

Scripture in Focus: Acts 1:15–26.

Learn by Heart: “Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,” Act 1:24.

After the tragic fall of Judas Iscariot, the early church sought to fill the empty apostolic office. Two men were considered, but only one was chosen—Matthias. Though not among the original twelve, Matthias had faithfully followed Jesus from the beginning (Acts 1:21–22). While Scripture doesn't tell us much more about him, the fact that he was chosen by prayer and casting of lots shows that God still honours consistency and quiet devotion.

His election teaches us that man may not always see your labor, but God never overlooks faithfulness. Matthias had no spotlight, no fame, yet he stayed near to Jesus through every step of His ministry. And when the time came, Heaven made its choice. You don’t need to campaign for God’s favour; walk faithfully in your calling, and your season of elevation will come.

Challenge: Keep following Jesus even when no one sees—your time of divine selection is near.

Prayer: Lord, help me to be faithful in obscurity, trusting that You see and reward in due time.


LESSON 26:			PAUL: ENCOUNTER THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING

Scripture in Focus: Acts 9:1–9; Galatians 1:13–16.

Learn by Heart: “But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal His Son in me,” Galatians 1:15–16a.

Saul was feared, powerful, and convinced he was doing God’s will by hunting down Christians. But on the road to Damascus, a divine interruption shattered his confidence and revealed his ignorance. Christ met him in glory, and in one blinding moment, the persecutor became the pursued. True encounters with Jesus break pride, reveal truth, and mark the beginning of real transformation. Saul didn’t just have a change of opinion; he had a rebirth of identity.

Many people know about Jesus, but only an encounter can make Him real to the soul. Paul's conversion shows us that God doesn’t wait for perfection—He initiates Grace while we are still in rebellion. From that moment, Saul the destroyer was buried, and Paul the disciple began to rise. What was once used against the Church would now be used to build it.

Challenge: Ask God for a deeper encounter that redefines your walk and witness.

Prayer: Lord, meet me in the depths of my heart and change me completely.


LESSON 27:		PAUL: THE DISCIPLE WHO WOULDN’T TURN BACK

Scripture in Focus: Philippians 3:7–14; 2 Timothy 4:6–8.

Learn by Heart: “But none of these things move me... so that I might finish my course with joy,” Acts 20:24.

Paul’s journey didn’t end with a conversion-it began there. Through beatings, imprisonment, shipwrecks, betrayals, and hunger, he pressed on, undeterred. His life’s goal became, "For my determined purpose is that I may know Him; that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him" (Philippians 3:10 AMPLIFIER). This was not a man holding onto faith casually—he was a burning example of total surrender. Discipleship, to Paul, meant embracing the cross, the cost, and the crown.

He wrote most of the New Testament not from a palace, but from prison. His words were not comfortable—they were convicting. As J.I. Packer said, “Paul’s letters are theology on fire.” His passion still ignites the Church today. When Paul said, “I have fought a good fight,” he wasn't boasting—he was bearing witness to the Grace that had sustained him. Let his life remind you that the road of discipleship is not easy, but it is eternally worth it. Sing this Song: "I live for Him who died for me, how happy then my life shall be, I live for Him who died for me, my Savior and my Lord"

Challenge: Live today as if Christ is worth everything—because He is.

Prayer: Lord, help me endure, serve, and finish strong in Your Grace.


LESSON 28:			THE REWARD OF TRUSTING GOD

Scripture Focus: Psalm 62:8.

Learn by Heart: “Trust in him at all times; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge,”  Psalm 62:8.

Life often places us at the crossroads, where our strength, wisdom, or resources seem inadequate. In such moments, trusting God becomes not only a command but a lifeline. Trust is not the absence of fear; it is the decision to hold onto God’s promises despite fear. An old farmer once said, “Faith is like planting a seed: you bury it, but you believe rain will come and life will spring forth.” In the same way, when we entrust our burdens to the Lord, we sow into His unfailing love, knowing that the harvest will come in due season.

Consider a story of a young boy whose kite got stuck on a tall tree. People mocked him for still holding the string, but he said, “Even if I don’t see the kite, I know it’s there.” Trust in God is like holding that string - even when you cannot see the outcome, your faith keeps you connected to His power. As one wisdom nugget says, “Trusting God is not a risk; it is the safest investment of life.” No storm can uproot a heart anchored in Him.

Challenge: What are you holding onto today that you need to hand over to God? Let go of fear, and let your trust become your testimony.

Prayer: Lord, teach me to trust You in all seasons and hold firmly to Your promises, even when the answers are not visible.

LESSON 1:	                     	    REBELLIOUS CHRISTIAN 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 1:1-4.
Learn by Heart: "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, o earth; for the LORD hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me", Isaiah 1:2.
Rebellion is one of the sins that God particularly frowns at. To rebel is to stop following God, to reduce one's love for God and His House and His people. When a child of God is more passionate about the things of this world (which will melt away one day) than the things of God and the fellowship of the saints, such people are in rebellious state. When you allow your occupation or any other thing to become your idol, that is rebellion. 
Spending most of your time on social media, without engaging in online business, when you ought to read and meditate on the Word of God or engage yourself in serious prayers or going out for evangelism; that's rebellion. Christians are the Judah and Jerusalem of our time. "They forsook God and got entangled with iniquities. They were the seed of evildoers, children that were corrupters, they have forsaken the LORD....". Is this not the state of God’s children today?
Challenge: Check your life, is the love of God and His house still there? If not, repent today.
Prayer: Oh God! heal my backsliding today.
                            
LESSON 2:			THE CONSEQUENCES OF REBELLION 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 1:5-9.
Learn by heart: "From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds and bruises, and putrefying sores; They have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment", Isaiah 1:6.
Rebellion implies departure from God or forsaking one's love for God, His work and His House, or replacing God's position with other things. This is likened to witchcraft, "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft", (1 Samuel 15:23a). It's consequences are very terrible and unbearable; Verse 6 and 7 of our text explains the consequences of Judah and Jerusalem's rebellion. "From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it". It means both the leaders and the led were wounded and bruised. They suffered desolation, strangers overthrew and devoured their land. Their cities were burnt with fire. 
God’s Children must examine their lives daily to find out if there is any form of rebellion in their lives and amend it. Rebellion brings the wrath of God upon individuals and it leads such people to hell fire. Depart from any form of rebellion.
Challenge: Examine your life, is what you are going through not the consequences of rebellion?
Prayer: Oh Lord Jesus! X tray my life, and reveal any form of rebellion and give me the Grace to amend my ways.


LESSON 3:				CALL TO HOLINESS 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 1:16-18.
Learn by Heart: "Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil", Isaiah 1:16.
The very nature of our God is holiness and without holiness no one can see God. The Bible encourages us to be holy because God is holy (1 Peter 1:15-16). Therefore, holiness is a must for heaven minded Christians. God told Prophet Isaiah to charge His people "Israel” that they should wash and make themselves clean, and put away evil deeds, meaning they should stop doing evil. He told them to learn to do right, to seek judgment and relieve the oppressed and to take care of the fatherless and widows. 
Paul the Apostle told Colossian Church, "But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds". Examine yourself if there is any sin, don't say it is your weakness, that's Satan Identification Number (SIN). Once you detect any in your life, run to Calvary; wash yourself in the Blood of Jesus and forsake such sin. Ask for Grace not to go back to it. You will obtain mercy in Jesus Name.
Challenge: Follow peace with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord". (Hebrew 12:14).
Prayer: Confess every known sin in your life and ask Jesus to wash you in His Blood and He will give you the Grace of "Sin no more".
                       
LESSON 4:			YOU WILL EAT THE GOOD OF THE LAND 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 1:19-20.
Learn by Heart: "If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land", Isaiah 1:19.
God’s plan and His thought towards His children are for them to enjoy the best of the land, for" The earth is the LORD'S and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein" (Psalm 24:1). Wherever you are now, God wants you to enjoy spiritual resources, material resources, human resources and financial resources, because He (God) owns everything (Haggai 2:8). God says "For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end". (Jeremiah 29:11). 
There are two steps we must take to enjoy the best of the land according to our text today: The are: willingness and obedience. All of us want to enjoy life and God's provisions, but not all are ready to obey God's commandments. If you want to live in abundance, pay your tithe and offering and give generously to the work of God and His people.
Challenge: Are you willing? Then be obedient.
Prayer: Oh God! Give me the Grace to obey you without any reservation.

LESSON 5:			JESUS: THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 2:1-5.
Learn by Heart: "And many people shall go and say, come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of  the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem", Isaiah 2:3.
The mountain of the LORD is the House of the LORD "That the mountain of the LORD'S house..,...".  "The house is established on the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills". In this house, people will learn the way of the LORD and they will walk therein. From there comes the law and the word of God that guide people in the path of righteousness. Jesus Christ is this mountain that is above all hills. Philippines 2:9, tells us that God has given Him a Name that is above every other name. 
If anyone is in Christ, such is right in the House of the LORD and His Name will be their protection, "The Name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it, and is safe" ( Proverbs 18:10). No condemnation for those in Him. (Romans 8:1). You will become a new creature and old things will pass away, (2 Corinthians 5:17). You will enjoy God and His provisions.
Challenge: Are you in Christ Jesus? If your answer is NO, give your life to Him today and you will never regret the decision. If yes, keep keeping on.
Prayer: My Father and my God, establish me in Christ that I may continue to enjoy the benefits that are there in Jesus.

LESSON 6:			THE DAY OF THE LORD IS COMING 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 2:12-22.
Learn by Heart: "For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon everyone that is proud and lofty,  and upon everyone that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low", Isaiah 2:12.
The Day of the LORD is judgment day, whereby the pride of the proud will be judged. God will judge the sins of the nations of the world, all the beauty and glories with the people will be judged. "But the day of the LORD will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up", (2 Peter 3:10). 
As children of God, truly born again, we ought to be wise. We are to do everything to please God and for His glory. Remember that you brought nothing to the world and you can take nothing out of it. Serve God with all you have and .make holiness your lifestyle. 
Challenge: Why prepare for the day of the wrath of God, when you have opportunity to repent.
Prayer: Oh Lord Jesus, deliver me from the sins that aim to destroy me in the Day of the LORD.

LESSON 7:		BLESSING FOR THE RIGHTEOUS AND CURSE TO THE WICKED 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 3:10-11.
Learn by heart: "I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live", Deuteronomy 30:19.
Our God is righteous. He wants all His children to be righteous in all aspects of our life. Wickedness is one of the attributes of the devil; so, God hates wickedness. God expects us to be righteous in handling other people's property. He wants you to be righteous in dealing with your bus (leaders) or your junior staff, your employer and employees. Deal righteously with those that commit one thing or the other to you. You must be righteous in handling money (church money, family money, company money, among others). 
It is an act of wickedness when you punish your employees or rob your employer, when you owe people and refuse to pay back, when you deny people their rights and privileges. The Bible says: "Say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands shall be given him", Isaiah 3:10-11.
Challenge: Who are you, the righteous or the wicked?
Prayer: Oh God, Purge me of every act of wickedness today.

LESSON 8:			THE BRANCH OF THE LORD 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 4:2-6.
Learn by heart: "I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me, ye can do nothing", John 15:5.
Here, Prophet Isaiah says "In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious.....". This describes the life of every genuinely born again Christian. Their life shall be beautiful. God beautifies their life with spiritual fruit (fruit is the beauty of every tree). Their life shall be glorious, for the glory of the LORD rises on them. "But the LORD shall arise upon thee, and His glory seen upon thee". (Isaiah 60:2b). 
There are steps to take to become a branch of the LORD: "even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem ". This means salvation. You must be genuinely saved by accepting Jesus as your Lord and Saviour. "When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem ". This is sanctification. You must be sanctified. Then you "shall be called holy ".
Challenge: Are you a true branch of the LORD?
Prayer: Lord Jesus, give me grace to abide in you.

LESSON 9:				THE VINEYARD OF THE LORD 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 5:1-7.
Learn by Heart: "For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah, his pleasant plant; and He looked for judgment but behold, oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry", Isaiah 5:7.
The song of the vineyard here, portrays the relationship between God and us, His people (Christians). God in His infinite mercy went to the market of slavery and purchased you and me with the precious blood of His Son, "Jesus Christ". Jesus healed our infirmities, took away our sicknesses, diseases and the curse. He settled us in a fruitful (fertile) land. He protects and preserves our lives from danger and attack of the enemies. He gives us rain of blessing (peace, sound health, good job, peaceful home and other possessions). That we may serve Him in truth and holiness.
His expectation from us as His vineyard is to reap the fruit of righteousness. But let's check our lives, what kind of fruit do we bear, works of the flesh or the fruit of the Spirit? (Galatians 5:19-23). Examine your life and turn to God completely to avoid the coming disaster.
Challenge: You are God’s vineyard; don't take the goodness of God in vain.
Prayer: Lord Jesus, help me to continually bear good fruits for you.

LESSON 10:			BEHOLDING THE HOLY GOD 
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 6:1-7.
Learn by Heart: "Then said I, woe is me! For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For mine eyes have seen the king, the LORD of hosts". Isaiah 6:5.
To behold the HOLY GOD is to have an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ. This experience leads to submission and brings forgiveness of sin, sanctification and total transformation. Prophet Isaiah started his ministry with the message of judgment and condemnation. He pronounced judgment upon Judah and Jerusalem, and declared the coming day of the LORD. But in chapter six, when he encountered God, he saw the true picture of his life in the mirror of the presence of the LORD. 
It was then he knew that he was a man of unclean lips. But his tongue was sanctified and his iniquities were removed. It was after this experience that he received the call of God and the next chapter he began to see and to speak about the sign of Emmanuel (Jesus Christ). Paul, the Apostle in Acts Chapter Nine encountered Jesus and his life was transformed. You as well need to behold the HOLY GOD today to discover your true picture in God’s sight.
Challenge: If truly you've encountered Jesus, you will work on yourself rather than condemning others.
Prayer: Oh Lord Jesus, position me before your mirror that I may know my true picture and amend my way.
                 
LESSON 11:		FEAR NOT! FOR THE PLAN OF THE ENEMY SHALL NOT STAND
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 7:4 -7.
Learn by heart: "Thus saith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass", Isaiah 7:7.
It is true that the plan of enemy is always evil. It is true that they gather against you to fight you. It is true that their speech to you is always in this form; "The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil, my lust shall be satisfied upon them: I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them' Exodus15:9. Though their plan is "Let us go up against Judah (you) and vex him......". Thus saith the Lord "It shall not stand neither shall it come to pass". The Bible says that “He disappointed the devices of the crafty, so that their hands can't perform their enterprises. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness ‘and the counsel of the froward is carried head long”, (Job 5:12, 13). 
God will rebuke them for your sake "He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure" (Psalm 2:4-5). You don't need to entertain fear. God is fighting for you. 
Challenge: Since Satan could not overcome Jesus, the enemy cannot overcome you.
Prayer: Oh God, never allow my enemies to overcome.
:
LESSON 12:					FEAR GOD
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 8:11-13.
Learn by Heart: "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter; Fear God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty of man", Ecclesiastes 12:13.
To fear God is to honour Him and keep His Words. To fear God entails keeping His statutes and diligently obeying His Commandments. When people claim to fear God, they keep themselves from everything that can grieve God .The fear of God makes you shun evil; it helps you to flee from sin. Many claim to fear God and they get themselves involved in immorality, lying, cheating, worldliness, wickedness, even rubbing God through tithe and offering. If truly you love God, you will not be arrogant; you will not maltreat the people under you. 
If you fear God, you will be regular and punctual in service. The Bible says "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom". It adds to knowledge. The Preacher tells us that the conclusion of the matter is to fear God and keep His Commandments. God asks "A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father where is mine honour? and if I be a master where is my fear ?.…..'. (Malachi 1:6).
Challenge: Is the fear of God in you? Why do you glory in sin then?
Prayer: Oh God, let your fear of guide me in all my daily affairs.

LESSON 13: 			COME TO THE LIGHT OF GOD
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 9:2-7. 
Learn by Heart: "in Him was life; and the life was the light of men -And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not", John 1:4-5.
Christ, the Lord, is the Light of the World, no one comes to Him, accepts and follows Him ever walks in darkness. This is every saved sinner’s testimony: When I was in the darkness of the world (in sin), my life was shapeless and without form. I was hopeless and lacked of focus , but when I encountered Jesus "the Light of the world, my life was transformed, the light of God  opened  my eyes and gave me hope. The enjoyments of sin are now things of the past in my life. They have become shameful things to me. (John 9:5). 
You will experience the same today, if you can give your life to Jesus, accept Him as your Lord and Saviour, confess all your known sins to Him and ask Him to forgive you and give you a new life. ."The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light, they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined”, Isaiah 9:2. Come to the greater light of God today and you  will  praise God .
Challenge: Jesus is the light of God. Remain in Him and you will never walk in darkness.
Prayer: I chase out, today, every form of darkness in my life, by the power of the Risen Christ.

LESSON 14: 			SALVATION FOR THE REMNANT
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 10:20-23
Learn by Heart: "For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men”, Titus 2:11.
God’s promise is to save you and your household "And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalth be saved, and thy house". (Acts 16:31). You as a genuinely born again Christian ought to prayerfully claim this promise of God. Pray that God should save your unbelieving spouse, son or daughter, father or mother, siblings, and members of your extended family, after reaching out to them with the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, in love and humility. 
If truly they are convinced of your salvation, they will surely listen to you and God will save them in Jesus Name. They will not be candidates of hell fire in Jesus Name. The Devil keeps afflicting people daily. Many are under the terrible bondage of sin and Satan. They are suffering seriously. Don't consider their achievement or wealth; pray for them and preach Jesus to them. God in His infinite mercy will save them in Jesus Name, Amen.
Challenge: Let your evangelism start from your Jerusalem.
Prayer: Lord Jesus, may my relatives open their hearts to the Gospel now. 

LESSON 15:					SONGS OF PRAISE
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 12:1-6.
Learn by Heart: "Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and His praise in the congregation of saints", Psalm 149:1.
We often appreciate God and thank Him for His provisions and protection, and all that we benefit from Him. We often share testimonies of His goodness among the people of God. All these are very good, but different from praise. To praise is to value His worth and magnify Him, examine the works of His hand and exalt Him. Praising God involves telling Him who and what He is to you and calling Him names that can gladden His heart. God is hungry and thirsty for our praise; praise is His meal. In fact, He made all things for His praise and glory.
Despite the fact that God is in serious hunger and thirst for our Praise, He will not accept praises that come from dirty vessels. Such praises irritate Him and He cannot accept such. To praise God in an acceptable manner, you must be righteous and holy.
Challenge: Why deny God your praise?
Prayer: Sing songs of praise to God.

LESSON 16:			GOS WILL HAVE MERCY ON YOU
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 14:1-3.
Learn by Heart: "For He saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion", Romans 9:15.
Our God is ever merciful, slow to anger and abounding in mercy. God told Israel through Prophet Isaiah,  that, " For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land, and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob". They had been rejected before, because of their iniquities, they were taken to slavery. But God told them that they would obtain mercy and yet be chosen. 
What are you going through right now? Maybe it is as a result of your sins. God will have mercy on you and choose you again. He will restore your losses and rebuild your ruins. All you need to do is to examine your life and fish out your fault, repent and confess them to God and ask for forgiveness. He will hearken to your voice.
Challenge: Go to the throne of Grace today that you may obtain mercy.
Prayer: Oh God of mercy, renew your mercy of old to me again today. 
LESSON 17:				LUCIFER’S FALL
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 14:12-19.
Learn by Heart: "But he giveth more grace, wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth, but giveth grace unto the humble", James 4:6.
Lucifer, who is called Satan and the devil, was initially called "son of the morning". He was the leader of Angels in heaven. He was recognized and respected by the angels of God, because of his position in the sight of God. He was the songs' leader in heaven. He was honoured by God until pride possessed him. “I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north". "I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High". 
Then God replied him, "Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit". God demoted him and cast him down. Children of God must learn from this. Whenever pride sets in, maybe because of your position, possession or power, remember Lucifer and call yourself to order. God hates pride of any kind. "God resists the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.”
Challenge: Pride comes before downfall.
Prayer: My Father and my God, deliver me from the spirit of pride and error.

LESSON 18:				GOD WILL FIGHT FOR YOU
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 29:5-6.
Learn by Heart: "Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away; yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly", Isaiah 29:5.
Our living God always defends and fights for His own. When the Israelites were in Egypt, Pharaoh and his people maltreated them heavily. God beheld them in His mercy and fought for them and delivered them. When King Jehoshaphat was confronted by some kings with multitude of soldiers; he cried to God and God stepped in to deliver them. David challenged Goliath, the Captain of the Philistines' army, though he was very young then. God fought for him and he brought down Goliath’s head. 
Mordecai and Esther cried to God in prayer that they might be delivered from Harman who had planned to eliminate all the Jews that were in Susan then, but when God intervened, their enemies were destroyed. The multitude of your enemies shall be destroyed according to the word of God, in Jesus Name. God has promised to contend with those that fight against you and He will surely fulfill His promise.
Challenge: Be careful and hold your peace, for the Lord God will fight for you.
Prayer: Oh God, arise and scatter all my enemies now and forever.

LESSON 19:				HEZEKIAH'S PRAYER
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 37:14-20.
Learn by Heart: "And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord ", Isaiah 37:15.
Prayer is the means by which God’s children communicate with him. Children of God suffer a lot today because they cannot pray. Many Christians love to complain rather than praying to God. There are promises in The Bible that we should "ask and it shall be given you; seek and you shall find, knock and  the door shall be opened unto you".( Mathew 7:7). "And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me". (Psalm 50:15). 
What are your worries? What are those things bordering your mind that trouble your spirit? What are your fears? Take them to God in heartfelt prayer today and they will be settled. Hezekiah did not waste time; he didn't consult people or idols; he took the letter straight to the presence of God and God answered him speedy. Take your problems to God in prayer today; be specific about them, believe Him, and He will surely answer you. He will not put you to shame.
Challenge: "For everyone that asketh recieveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened". (Mathew 7:8). Seize the opportunity of these promises today.
Prayer: Take all your worries to God in prayer. Mark this day with three important Prayer Requests.

LESSON 20:			THE LORD'S HAND IS NOT SHORTENED
Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 59:1-4.
Learn by heart: "Behold the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear". Isaiah 59:1.
Our God is the God of the whole universe, He is unlimited. The Maker of all creatures, there is nothing He cannot do. There is no impossibility with Him. He can do beyond our imagination. Prophet Jeremiah was fully aware of this. No wonder he said "Ah Lord God! Behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee". (Jeremiah 32:17). 
You only need to examine your life, if there is anything that has drawn you away from God’s presence. If there is any, repent, confess and come back to God. Tell Him to draw you close to Himself again He will hear your cry. "Behold I am the LORD, the God of all flesh, is there anything too hard for me?” (Jeremiah 32:27)..
Challenge: The LORD'S hand is not shortened to save and deliver you.
Prayer: Oh God of all flesh, deliver me totally from all my troubles.

LESSON 21:					THE RED SEA

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:13-14.

Learn by Heart: “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.., Isaiah 43:2a.

The Red Sea represents the impossible situations we often face — moments where the past is chasing us and the future seems blocked. For the Israelites, the Red Sea was a test of trust in God's power and presence. It was at the moment of fear and seeming defeat that God revealed Himself as the Maker of ways. Moses’ instruction to "stand still" reminds us that divine intervention often begins where human effort ends. When God stretches His hand, the sea splits, and what once looked like death became a pathway to destiny.

How we face many "Red Seas" today-financial struggles, family crises, spiritual stagnation, or uncertainties. But like Israel, we must believe that God is not intimidated by our impossibilities. He specializes in making a way where there is none. The same God who brought Israel through on dry ground will also lead you through your trials. Your enemies, like Pharaoh's army, will not prevail. Trust Him, move forward in faith, and watch the waters part. Over the next seven days, we'll explore together the theme "The Red Sea".

Challenge: What Red Sea are you facing today? Instead of panicking, stand still and trust God to make a way. Take time to reflect on His past faithfulness and declare His promises over your present storm.

Prayer: Fight for me, Lord, and let every obstacle become a testimony to Your power. 


LESSON 22:			WHEN THE SEA STANDS BEFORE YOU

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:9, 10.

Learn by Heart: “The Name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe”, Proverbs 18:10.

There they stood—delivered but surrounded. The sea was before them, Pharaoh’s army behind, and their hearts melted with fear. After all the signs and wonders in Egypt, this was not the freedom they pictured. It felt like God had brought them out just to be destroyed. But we must understand this: when you follow God, Red Sea moments are not signs of abandonment, but opportunity for the manifestation of His power. The God who leads His people into deep waters never leaves them to drown. He leads us to the edge so we can see His hand stretched out. What terrified the Israelites was about to become their testimony.

Matthew Henry once commented, “God sometimes raises difficulties in the way of His people that He may have the glory of subduing them.” That’s exactly what the Red Sea was—a moment for God to show that nothing can stop His promise. Your “Red Sea” might be a sickness, a loss, a delay, or a decision, but don’t be discouraged. The sea before you is not your end; it's God’s next miracle. Stop looking at what’s chasing you and start looking to the One who never fails. 
Sing this song: "Big Mountain, Small Mountain, strong wind can't withstand you, how Great my God is, You are great oh my God"

Challenge: Speak faith over whatever sea stands before you today and believe God is already working a way through it.

Prayer: Lord, I trust You to turn every impossible situation before me into a testimony


LESSON 23:					STAND STILL

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:13.

Learn by Heart: “Be still, and know that I am God..,”  Psalm 46:10(a).

In the face of danger, we naturally want to fight or flee. But God told the Israelites something completely different: “Stand still.” It wasn’t a command to freeze in fear, but an instruction to quiet their hearts and hold their ground in trust. Stillness before God is not weakness—it’s strength under control. Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is stop running, stop talking, stop analyzing, and just stand. The battle wasn't theirs to fight—it was the Lord’s. To stand still is to admit, “I can’t do this, but God can.” And that is where miracles begin.

Charles Spurgeon said, “To stand at ease in the day of battle, is to be a coward; but to stand calmly in the Lord’s strength, is true bravery.” The enemy wants to push you into panic, but God is calling you to a different kind of response: peace in the storm. The Red Sea didn’t part while Israel was running—it parted when they stood in place, listening to God’s voice. There’s a time to move, but first, there’s a time to be still. Don’t confuse stillness with inactivity; it’s faith choosing not to flinch.

Challenge: Take ten minutes today to quiet your heart and wait silently before God.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, help me to stand still and trust You, even when everything around me feels uncertain.


LESSON 24:			THE GOD WHO MAKES A WAY

Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 43:16, 19.

Learn by Heart: “I am the Lord, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters”, Isaiah 43:16.

The Red Sea was never a surprise to God—it was a stage He had prepared. Long before the waters blocked Israel’s path, God already had the solution written into His plan. That’s what makes Him God. He is the One who makes a way where there is no way. He doesn’t just lead us out; He carries us through. Isaiah’s prophecy was a reminder that God doesn’t repeat old miracles—He creates new wonders. The same power that parted the sea is still working in the lives of those who trust Him today.
God doesn’t need a road to make a way—He creates one where none exists. What men call impossible is the very thing God uses to show His glory. 

Warren Wiersbe said, “When God opens the way, He also removes the fear.” The Red Sea wasn’t meant to drown Israel; it was meant to display God’s power. Don’t judge your future by what’s in front of you now. God is the Author of new things, and the sea before you may be His chosen path into your next testimony.

Challenge: Trust God today for something that seems humanly impossible and expect His intervention.

Prayer: Lord, I believe You are the Maker of Ways - do something new and undeniable in my life.


LESSON 25:					GO FORWARD

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:15.

Learn by Heart: “For we walk by faith, not by sight,” 2 Corinthians 5:7.

There comes a moment when prayer must give way to action. God had heard the cries of His people, but now He said, “Go forward.” It was an instruction that made no logical sense—there was no bridge, no boat, no dry ground in sight. Yet God wasn’t asking them to walk into water blindly; He was commanding them to walk in faith. Faith doesn’t wait for the waters to part before moving—it moves because God has spoken. Until they obeyed the call to go forward, the sea remained closed. Movement unlocks miracles.

God often calls us to step before we see. It's in obedience that the power of God is released. Faith is not a feeling—it is movement in the direction of God's promise, even when your surroundings contradict it. As a preacher once said, “If you wait for the sea to part before stepping in, you might wait forever—but if you step in when God says move, the sea has no choice but to yield.” Going forward may feel risky, but staying still in fear is far more dangerous.

Challenge: Take one bold step today toward something God has placed on your heart, no matter how unsure it looks.

Prayer: Lord, I will not wait for signs—I will move in obedience, trusting that You go before me.


LESSON 26:				THE WIND BLEW ALL NIGHT

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:21; Psalms 27:14.

Learn by Heart: “The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him,” Lamentations 3:25.

God could have split the Red Sea in an instant, but He chose to send a strong east wind that blew all through the night. This quiet detail reminds us that God sometimes works slowly, steadily, and silently. While Israel waited in the dark, the miracle was already underway. They couldn’t see the wind moving, but it was parting the waters. Just because your breakthrough isn’t immediate doesn’t mean God is not at work. Sometimes, He works in the unseen before He reveals it in the open.

Waiting seasons are not wasted seasons. They are times when God does deep, foundational work—shifting, clearing, and making a way beneath the surface. The darkness may linger, but dawn is coming. Charles Spurgeon once wrote, “God is too good to be unkind, and He is too wise to be mistaken… When you cannot trace His hand, trust His heart.” The night may feel long, but God’s wind is blowing. Don’t give up—He’s preparing a path you haven’t seen yet.

Challenge: Stay calm in the season of waiting—God is working, even in the dark.

Prayer: Lord, I may not see what You're doing, but I trust that You are making a way for me through the night.


LESSON 27:				THE SEA BECAME A WALL

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:22.

Learn by Heart: “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee… they shall not overflow thee,” Isaiah 43:2.

What once terrified Israel now stood as a wall of protection beside them. The same sea that threatened to drown them became the very evidence of God’s hand making a way. God didn’t just make the ground dry—He made the waters rise like walls. Psalm 77:19 says, “Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.” When God moves, He doesn’t always take you out of danger—He takes you through it, with His presence on every side.

Imagine walking with water towering to your left and right, yet not a drop touching you. That’s what divine protection looks like. God doesn’t remove every challenge, but He surrounds you with His glory while you pass through it. The enemy can see your progress, but he can’t touch you. What was once an obstacle now becomes a testimony. Let this remind you: when God parts the sea, He doesn’t leave you to walk alone—He walks with you, wall to wall.

Challenge: Choose to walk confidently today knowing God has placed His protection on every side of your journey.

Prayer: Thank You Jesus because what was once meant to drown me now stands as proof of Your power.


LESSON 28:				THE SEA CLOSED AGAIN

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:28.
 
Learn by Heart: “The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace,”  Exodus 14:14.

When Israel had safely crossed, the waters that had stood as walls came crashing down. What was a path for God’s people became a grave for their enemies. God not only delivers—He destroys what once pursued you. He doesn’t just bring you out; He makes sure what chased you doesn’t return. The Red Sea didn’t just part—it finished the battle. Deuteronomy 28:7 says, “The Lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face…” God ends what He starts, and when He brings you through, He closes the chapter completely.

This is the kind of victory that silences fear. Psalm 46:9 says, “He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth…” That’s what the Red Sea symbolizes: divine closure. The Egyptians didn’t disappear until Israel had fully crossed—God allowed His people to see their deliverance. And, today, you, too, will witness the downfall of what has tried to overpower you. The enemies you see today, you will see no more. The sea was both deliverance and judgment. Trust God to finish what He began.

Challenge: Rejoice today, knowing that God not only brings you out, but He removes the threat behind you.

Prayer: Lord, thank You for giving me complete victory and for silencing every voice that once pursued me.


LESSON 29:					I AM NOT MY OWN

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 6:19–20.

Learn by Heart: “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,” Galatians 2:20(a).

The world says, “Be your own person,” but the Cross says, “You are not your own.” This is the paradox of the Christian life: the "I" must die so Christ may live. The Apostle Paul makes it clear that our identity isn’t self-made—it’s Christ-defined. The moment we accepted Jesus, we surrendered the throne of our hearts. The “I” that used to rule was crucified with Christ. Now, every step we take, every thought we think, and every decision we make must answer to the One who owns us. In this death to self lies true life.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer once wrote, “When Christ calls a man, He bids him come and die.” The modern believer must resist the temptation to live for self while bearing the Name of Christ. The “I” must give way to “Him.” This shift is not loss—it is liberty. You are no longer under the pressure to define your worth or defend your name. You belong to the One who paid the price for your soul. The Christian life is not about improving the old self; it is about living from a new identity that begins with surrender.

Challenge: Today, lay down your self-rights and confess that you belong fully to Christ.

Prayer: Lord, I surrender all that I am, for I am not my own—I am Yours forever.


LESSON 30:					I DIE DAILY

Scripture in Focus: 1 Corinthians 15:31.

Learn by Heart: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me,”  Luke 9:23.

Paul didn’t say, “I died once.” He said, “I die daily.” This is not poetic language—it is the cost of discipleship. The “I” in us resists surrender. It wants to be heard, honored, and in control. But true maturity in Christ is measured by how consistently we put self to death. Daily dying means denying our desires when they contradict His will. It means letting go of pride, ambition, and entitlement—things our flesh clings to. It’s not just about what we do on Sundays, but what we choose Monday through Saturday, when no one is watching.

F.B. Meyer once said, “The only hope of decreasing self is the increase of Christ.” Dying daily is painful, but it’s also powerful. Each death to self makes more room for Jesus to live through us. Each act of humility silences the ego. The more you die to self, the more alive you become in the Spirit. If we want resurrection power, we must walk the path of crucifixion. The self-life must fall into the ground and die before it can bear fruit (John 12:24). This is the hidden strength of the believer—not in asserting the “I,” but in crucifying it.

Challenge: Practice self-denial today in one area where your flesh demands to be heard.

Prayer: I choose to die to myself today so that Your life may be revealed through me.



LESSON 31:				I CAN DO ALL THINGS

Scripture in Focus: Philippians 4:13.

Learn by Heart: “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God,” 2 Corinthians 3:5.

This verse is often quoted to boost confidence, but its true power lies not in self-belief—but in Christ-dependence. Paul didn’t mean “I” can do everything because I am strong, skilled, or smart. He meant the opposite: “I” am weak, but He is strong through me. The “I” in Christ is no longer self-reliant but Christ-reliant. What Paul discovered was that contentment, endurance, and success in life are possible—not by willpower, but through divine empowerment. What the flesh cannot achieve, grace enables.

Augustine once wrote, “God does not demand what He has not already provided.” Christ is not merely your helper; He is your very life. When “I” step back, Christ steps forward. Whether facing need or abundance, persecution or peace, the strength to stand does not come from the “I” but from the indwelling Christ. This is the mystery of grace: the “I” that dies daily becomes the “I” that does all things—not by effort, but by surrender. The more you lean on Him, the more you’ll discover the supernatural strength hidden in submission.

Challenge: Take one difficult task today and rely entirely on Christ’s strength to accomplish it.

Prayer: Lord, I acknowledge I can do nothing without You—but through You, I can do all things.


APRIL 2026

LESSON 1:				A VISION OF CHRIST’S GLORY
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 1:9–20. 
Learn by Heart: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore,”  Revelation 1:18.
John, exiled on the lonely island of Patmos, received a vision that changed everything. He saw Jesus, not as the suffering servant on the Cross, but as the risen, glorified King. His hair was white like snow, His eyes blazed with fire, and His voice was like many waters. This was the Christ who conquered death and now stands as Lord over all. John, overwhelmed, fell at His feet as though dead. Yet, Jesus touched him and said, “Fear not.” 
What a picture of both power and tenderness! Jesus is majestic, yet approachable; holy, yet merciful. The same Jesus who holds the keys of death and hell is also the One who comforts us when we are afraid. In our struggles, doubts, or lonely places, He comes alongside us and reminds us He is alive forevermore. That truth gives us courage that, our Lord is not distant, He walks with His people every day. 
Challenge: Spend time today reflecting on Christ’s majesty. How does seeing Him as the glorified Lord change how you face your fears? 
Prayer: Lord Jesus, open my eyes to see You in Your glory. Help me to walk with reverence and confidence, knowing You hold my life in Your hands.

DAY 2: 					LOVE THAT CORRECTS 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 2:1–7. 
Learn by Heart: “Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love,” Revelation 2:4.
The church at Ephesus had many good works. They were diligent, discerning, and faithful in service. Yet, Jesus had a concern for them, that they had abandoned their first love. What a sobering reminder! It is possible to be busy for God, but distant from Him in heart. True love for Christ is not about endless activity, but about intimacy with Him. Jesus, in His love, called them to remember, repent, and return to the passion they once had. 
His correction is not to condemn, but to restore. He wants our relationship with Him to be vibrant, not mechanical. A marriage established without love always grows cold. In the same way, our walk with Christ should overflow with affection, joy, and desire to please Him. When our love grows weak, He gently calls us back. 
Challenge: Reflect on your relationship with Jesus. Is your love growing stronger, or has it grown routine? Take time today to renew your devotion to Him. 
Prayer: Lord, forgive me where my love has grown cold. Draw me back to You with fresh passion and joy. Restore the fire of my first love.


DAY 3: 				FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 2:8–11. 
Learn by Heart: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life,” Revelation 2:10. 
The Church in Smyrna faced persecution, poverty, and suffering. Yet Jesus encouraged them not to fear, but to remain faithful, even unto death. What an incredible challenge! Faith is not just about believing when times are easy, it shines brightest when tested in fire. Jesus did not promise them freedom from trials, but gave them something greater: the assurance of eternal life. He reminded them that the crown of life awaits those who endure. 
Today, the pressures may look different: mockery, rejection, struggles at work, or personal battles. But the call remains the same: be faithful. Faithfulness means trusting God even when we don’t understand, obeying Him when it’s not convenient, and holding on to His promises even when everything shakes. Jesus is with us in every trial, and no suffering is wasted when endured for Him. 
Challenge: In what area of your life do you feel pressure to compromise your faith? Choose today to remain faithful to Christ. 
Prayer: Lord, strengthen me to stand firm in times of trial. Help me to remain faithful and focused on the crown of life You have promised.

DAY 4: 			THE COMPROMISING CHURCH
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 2:12–17. 
Learn by Heart: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna,” Revelation 2:17.
The Church at Pergamos lived in a city known for idolatry and immorality. Some believers remained faithful, but others began to compromise by embracing false teachings. Jesus reminded them that truth matters, and compromise with sin is dangerous. His warning shows that following Him means standing firm, even when culture pulls us the other way. Compromise often starts small, for example, justifying little sins, blending in with the world, or excusing disobedience. 
But Jesus’ call is higher. He promises hidden manna, that is, spiritual strength and eternal satisfaction are for those who remain pure. Walking with Christ may sometimes feel lonely, but it leads to deep joy and eternal reward. Remember, the world may applaud compromise, but heaven honours faithfulness. 
Challenge: Is there any area of your life where compromise has crept in? Be honest with God and choose to stand firm in His truth. 
Prayer: Lord, give me strength to resist compromise and courage to stand for the truth. Let me hunger for the hidden manna that only You can give.

DAY 5:				HOLD FAST TILL I COME 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 2:18–29.. 
Learn by Heart: “But that which ye have already hold fast till I come,.” Revelation 2:25. 
The Church in Thyatira was known for love, service, and patience. But they tolerated false teaching that led many into sin. Jesus praised their growth, but also called them to deal with sin firmly. His words, “hold fast till I come,” remind us that the Christian journey requires endurance. Faith is not about starting well alone but about finishing strong.  It is therefore important as Believers to lay aside every things that may take our eyes from looking unto the coming King.
Holding fast means clinging to God’s truth, guarding what He has entrusted to us, and refusing to let go even when tempted. In a world full of distractions and deception, we must anchor ourselves in Christ. He promises authority and the morning star to those who overcome. What a reward! 
Challenge: Are you holding tightly to God’s truth, or letting go little by little? Choose today to stay rooted in His Word and promises. 
Prayer: Lord, help me to hold fast to Your Word. Give me strength to endure and finish strong until You come. 

DAY 6:		WAKE UP AND STRENGTHEN WHAT REMAINS 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 3:1–6. 
Learn by Heart: “Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die,” Revelation 3:2.
The Church in Sardis had a reputation for being alive, but Jesus declared they were spiritually dead. Outwardly, they looked fine, but inwardly their faith was weak. What a warning for us today! It is easy to appear spiritual, for example, attending services, speaking the right words, yet, lack a living connection with Christ. Jesus urged them to wake up, strengthen what remained, and repent. 
This shows His mercy; He had not given up on them. Sometimes we may feel our fire for God is fading, our prayers weaker, our joy gone. Yet Jesus says, “Wake up!” Even a little spark can be fanned into flame again. He desires us to walk with Him in purity, clothed in white, with our names secure in the Book of Life. 
Challenge: Examine your walk with Christ. Do you need to wake up spiritually? Ask the Holy Spirit to revive your passion for Him today. 
Prayer: Lord, awaken my heart to Your presence. Strengthen what remains in me, and restore my fire for You.

DAY 7: 				THE FAITHFUL CHURCH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 3:7–13. 
Learn by Heart: “Behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it,” Revelation 3:8. 
The Church in Philadelphia received no rebuke from Jesus. They had little strength, yet they kept His Word and did not deny His Name. That is the beauty of faithfulness. It is not about being the strongest, but about holding on to Christ at all cost. Jesus promised them an open door no one could shut, protection from trials, and the honour of being pillars in God’s Temple. What an encouragement! Often, we feel weak in our faith, like we don’t have much to offer. Yet, God sees our endurance and obedience. 
He values faithfulness over fame, consistency over charisma. The world may overlook the quiet believer who prays faithfully, loves others, and clings to God’s Word but heaven sees. Jesus’ promise to make us pillars shows permanence and honour in His presence. Those who hold fast will receive a crown and a new name, forever secure in Him. 
Challenge: Even if your strength feels small, remain faithful. What little act of obedience can you commit to today? 
Prayer: Lord, help me to stay faithful, even when I feel weak. Keep me steady in Your Word and strong in Your promises.

DAY 8:                			 LUKEWARM FAITH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 3:14–22 
Learn by Heart: “I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot,” Revelation 3:15. 
The Church in Laodicea thought they were rich and needed nothing, but Jesus saw them as poor, blind, and naked. Their lukewarm faith made Him sick. This is a powerful warning. Lukewarm faith is half-hearted Christianity, comfortable, self-reliant, and lacking passion. Jesus calls us to wake up, repent, and let Him in. Notice His love: He stands at the door and knocks, patiently waiting for us to open our hearts fully to Him. 
Lukewarmness creeps in subtly and we begin to pray less, compromise more, abscond from fellowship and become satisfied with surface religion. But Jesus desires a fiery, wholehearted love. He rebukes because He loves, and He disciplines to restore. True riches, white garments, and spiritual sight come only from Him. When we let Him in, He doesn’t just visit, but He dines with us, sharing fellowship and intimacy. 
Challenge: Is your faith lukewarm or burning? Invite Jesus to reignite your passion and devotion today. 
Prayer: Lord, forgive me for being lukewarm. Set my heart on fire with love for You, and help me to open the door wide to Your presence.

DAY 9:			 WORSHIP AROUND THE THRONE 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 4:1–11. 
Learn by Heart: “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power,” Revelation 4:11.
John was caught up into heaven and saw God’s throne surrounded by beauty and majesty. Lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and around the throne were living creatures crying, “Holy, holy, holy.” Twenty-four elders fell down and cast their crowns before the Lord, declaring His worth. This scene reminds us that worship is not about us, but about God’s greatness. In heaven, all creation centers on Him, giving Him glory. 
True worship flows from seeing who God is; holy, powerful, eternal, and worthy. Sometimes we reduce worship to music styles or feelings, but real worship is surrender, reverence, and adoration. When we worship, we join heaven’s song. It also lifts our hearts above our troubles, reminding us that God sits enthroned and in control. Whatever may be happening around us, He is still worthy of all praise. 
Challenge: Spend time today in heartfelt worship. Don’t ask for anything, just honour God for who He is. 
Prayer: Lord, You are worthy of all glory, honour, and power. Teach me to worship You in spirit and truth, joining heaven’s song every day.

DAY 10: 			         THE WORTHY LAMB 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 5:1–14. 
Learn by Heart: “Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing,” Revelation 5:12.
John wept when no one was found worthy to open the scroll in God’s hand. But then he saw the Lion of Judah, the Lamb who was slain. Jesus alone is worthy because of His sacrifice on the cross. At once, heaven erupted in worship, declaring His worth. What a picture of victory through humility! Jesus conquered, not with armies, but by laying down His life. 
This truth changes how we live: strength often comes through surrender, and victory often comes through sacrifice. If heaven focuses on Jesus, shouldn’t our lives also center on Him? Too often we focus on our problems or our own strength, but the Lamb who was slain is the answer. One day, all creation will bow before Him. Today, we have the privilege of joining that eternal song.
 “Worthy! Worthy!!Is the Lamb, Worthy! Worthy!!Is the Lamb, Worthy! Worthy!!Is the Lamb that was slain.
Glory Halleluyah, Glory Halleluyah, Glory Halleluyah,  Praise the Lord.

Challenge: Reflect on Jesus as the worthy Lamb. How can you live today in a way that honours His Name? 
Prayer: Lord Jesus, You are worthy of all praise. Thank You for conquering through Your sacrifice. Help me to live humbly and faithfully for You.

DAY 11: 					SEALED BY GOD 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 7:1–8.
Learn by Heart: “Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads,” Revelation 7:3.
Before judgment fell, God commanded that His servants be sealed with His mark of protection. This seal showed ownership and security, that they belonged to God, and nothing could harm them without His permission. What a comforting truth! As believers, we are also sealed, not with ink or wax, but with the Holy Spirit. God knows those who are His, and He keeps them safe. Even when the world shakes, God’s people are secure in His hands. 
Sometimes life feels uncertain, but God’s seal reminds us that our future is safe in Him. No enemy, no trial, and no storm can separate us from His love. The world may overlook us, but heaven knows our names. Being sealed also calls us to live as God’s own, shining as His witnesses in a dark world. 
Challenge: Remember today that you are sealed by God. Live with confidence and walk in the assurance of His love. 
Prayer: Lord, thank You that I am sealed as Yours. Keep me strong and faithful, and let my life show that I belong to You.

DAY 12: 			SALVATION BELONGS TO OUR GOD 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 7:9–17. 
Learn by Heart: “Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb,” Revelation 7:10. 
John saw a vast multitude from every nation, clothed in white robes, standing before God’s throne and worshipping Him. They had endured great trials, but were now safe in His presence, their tears wiped away, their hunger and thirst satisfied. What a beautiful picture of hope! Life here is full of challenges, sorrow, pain, rejection and loss, but this vision reminds us that it will not always be so. For those who trust in Christ, the future is glorious. 
We will stand in His presence, clothed in purity, sheltered by His love, and shepherded by the Lamb. He Himself will wipe away every tear. This truth should encourage us to endure hardship with hope. Earthly suffering cannot compare to heavenly joy. Salvation is God’s gift, not our achievement, and one day we will see the fullness of it in His presence. 
“Halleluyah, Salvation and Glory;
And Honour; and Power;
Unto our Lord and God”!

Challenge: When troubles weigh you down, lift your eyes to heaven and remember the joy that awaits you. 

Prayer: Lord, thank You for the promise of eternal joy in Your presence. Keep me faithful until I join that great multitude.

DAY 13: 		THE GREAT MULTITUDE IN WHITE ROBES 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 7:9–17. 
Learn by Heart: “They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more… For the Lamb… shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,” Revelation 7:16–17.
John saw a great crowd, too many to count, from every nation, tribe, and language. They stood before the throne, clothed in white robes, holding palm branches, and crying out, “Salvation belongs to our God!” These were people who came out of great trials and washed their robes in the Blood of the Lamb. What a beautiful picture of victory! Life here is full of struggles, tears, and pain, but this vision reminds us that there is an end. God Himself promises to wipe away every tear. 
The Lamb, Jesus Christ, will shepherd His people into everlasting joy and satisfaction. Sometimes we feel weary, discouraged, or even alone in our walk of Faith. But heaven shows us that we are part of a great family of believers, past and present, standing strong in God’s presence. One day, all suffering will be over, and joy will take its place forever. 
Challenge: Remember that you are part of a greater family of Faith. Hold on with hope. What trialS do you need to endure today with eternity in mind? 
Prayer: Lord, thank You for the hope of heaven. Help me endure trials with courage and fix my eyes on the Lamb who wipes away every tear, at last. 

DAY 14: 		THE SEVENTH SEAL AND SILENCE IN HEAVEN 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 8:1–6. 
Learn by Heart: “And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour,” Revelation 8:1.
When the seventh seal was opened, heaven fell silent for about half an hour. After the thunderous worship and activity around the throne, the sudden silence is striking. It was a holy pause, a moment of awe and reverence before God’s judgment was released on the earth. This silence reminds us that sometimes the most powerful worship is quietness before the Lord. In our busy, noisy world, we can easily forget the beauty of stillness. 
Silence gives room for reflection, reverence, and listening to God’s voice. The prayers of the saints were then offered before God, showing us that heaven takes notice of our prayers. They rise before Him like incense. Even when we feel our prayers are small or weak, heaven counts them precious. The silence also warns us that God is patient but not indifferent, that is, He will act in His time. 
Challenge: Take some minutes today to sit in silence before God. What might He want to whisper to your heart? 
Prayer: Lord, teach me to value silence in Your presence. Help me to listen for Your voice and trust that my prayers reach Your throne.

DAY 15: 			THE TRUMPETS OF JUDGMENT 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 8:7–13; 9:1–6. 
Learn by Heart: “And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound,” Revelation 8:6.
The seven trumpets brought devastating judgments on the earth: hail and fire, burning mountains, darkened skies, and tormenting locusts. These visions are frightening, but they remind us of God’s holiness and justice. Sin is not a light matter to God, and He will bring judgment on a world that rejects Him. Yet, even in judgment, God shows mercy by giving people time to repent. Sadly, many still refuse to turn to Him. 
This passage calls us to take sin seriously and to live in readiness for Christ’s return. It also challenges us to pray for those who do not yet know Jesus because, one day, time will run out. The trumpets remind us that God’s patience has a limit. Today is the day of salvation. Instead of living in fear of judgment, we can rejoice that Christ has saved us and given us eternal security. 
Challenge: Pray today for someone who is far from God. Ask the Lord to soften their heart before it is too late. 
Prayer: Lord, help me to live in holiness and readiness for Your return. Give me boldness to share Your love with others while there is still time.

DAY 16:			 THE ANGEL AND THE LITTLE SCROLL 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 10:1–11. 
Learn by Heart: “Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings,” Revelation 10:11. 
John saw a mighty angel with a little scroll in his hand. He was told to eat the scroll. It tasted sweet in his mouth, but turned bitter in his stomach. This strange act symbolized the message of God’s Word—sweet to receive, but often bitter when lived out, especially when it involves judgment. As believers, we too must take in God’s Word fully, not just the parts that are easy or comforting. The truth of God’s message includes both grace and judgment, joy and sorrow. 
John was then commanded to keep speaking God’s message to all nations. Sometimes we shy away from sharing God’s Word because parts of it may be unpopular or challenging. But our task is to be faithful messengers, just as John was. God’s Word transforms us and equips us to witness, even when it’s not easy. 
Challenge: What part of God’s Word is sweet to you? What part is harder to accept? Ask God for strength to live and share both. 
Prayer: Lord, help me to fully receive and live out Your Word, both the sweet and the bitter. Make me bold to share Your truth with others.

DAY 17:				 THE TWO WITNESSES 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 11:1–14. 
Learn by Heart: “And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth,” Revelation 11:3.
God raised up two witnesses to testify during a dark time of judgment. They spoke boldly, performed miracles and stood as lights in a hostile world. Eventually, they were killed, but after three and a half days, God raised them to life, and great fear fell on their enemies. This story reminds us that God always keeps a witness on earth. 
No matter how dark the world becomes, His truth will not be silenced. It also shows us that being a witness often comes with sacrifice, opposition, or even suffering. Yet God’s power is greater than death itself. As believers, we are called to be His witnesses today, at work, at school, in our families, and in our communities. We may face ridicule or rejection, but God promises to be with us and to give us strength. 
Challenge: Where is God calling you to stand boldly as His witness today? 
Prayer: Lord, make me a bold and faithful witness of Your truth. Strengthen me to shine for You even in difficult places, knowing that You hold my life in Your hands. 

DAY 18: 	THE SEVENTH TRUMPET: THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 11:15–19. 
Learn by Heart: “The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever,” Revelation 11:15.
When the seventh trumpet sounded, heaven erupted with loud voices declaring that the kingdoms of this world now belong to Christ. The twenty-four elders fell on their faces and worshipped, giving thanks that the Lord reigns forever. What a powerful reminder that history is not random, but it is moving toward this moment when Jesus will reign over all. Right now, the world looks divided and controlled by earthly powers, but Scripture assures us that Christ will have the final word. The nations rage, but God’s purposes cannot be stopped. 
For believers, this is a source of great comfort. Whatever injustice, corruption, or chaos we see today, we know a day is coming when Jesus will set everything right. This hope gives us strength to keep trusting, serving, and living for Him until that day comes. 
Challenge: As you watch world events, remind yourself: “Jesus will reign forever.” How can you live with this confidence today? 
Prayer: Lord, thank You that the kingdoms of this world belong to You. Help me to live with faith and hope, trusting that You reign now and forever.

DAY 19:		 THE WOMAN AND THE DRAGON 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 12:1–11.
Learn by Heart: “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death,” Revelation 12:11. 
John saw a vision of a woman clothed with the sun and a great red dragon waiting to destroy her child. This powerful picture points to Satan’s hatred of Christ and His people. The dragon represents the devil, always seeking to oppose God’s work. But the good news is that the child, called the Messiah, was caught up to God, and victory belongs to Him. 
Believers are not left helpless; Scripture says we overcome the enemy by the Blood of the Lamb and by our testimony. This means our victory is rooted in Jesus’ sacrifice, not in our strength. We also triumph when we boldly speak of what God has done in our lives, refusing to be silenced by fear. Though Satan fights fiercely, he is already defeated through Christ’s cross and resurrection. That is our confidence today. 
Challenge: What area of your life feels like a battle? Apply the Blood of Jesus over it and declare your testimony of His power. 
Prayer: Lord, thank You that I have victory through the Blood of Jesus. Help me to live boldly, speak truthfully, and stand strong against the enemy’s attacks.

DAY 20:		 	THE BEAST FROM THE SEA 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 13:1–10. 
Learn by Heart: “Here is the patience and the faith of the saints,” Revelation 13:10.
John saw a beast rising from the sea, full of power and authority given by the dragon. The world marveled and worshiped the beast, asking, “Who is like him?” This vision points to worldly systems and leaders who oppose God and demand loyalty. It reminds us that the spirit of antichrist is real, seeking to draw hearts away from true worship. 
Yet, in the middle of this dark picture, we are reminded that God’s people must endure with patience and faith. The beast may seem powerful for a season, but his authority is temporary. God’s Word calls us not to be deceived by appearances, but to remain faithful, no matter the cost. The world may pressure us to compromise, but our loyalty belongs to Christ alone. Even in the face of opposition, our hope rests in His eternal reign. 
Challenge: Where are you tempted to compromise your faith to fit in with the world? Ask God for strength to remain loyal. 
Prayer: Lord, keep my heart faithful to You. Help me to stand firm in patience and faith, even when the world pressures me to compromise. 

DAY 21: 			THE BEAST FROM THE EARTH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 13:11–18. 
Learn by Heart: “Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast,” Revelation 13:18. 
John saw another beast, this time from the earth, who looked like a lamb but spoke like a dragon. He deceived people with signs and forced them to receive a mark in order to buy or sell. This beast represents false religion and deceptive power, working to mislead people into worshiping the first beast. The danger here is spiritual deception, that is, things that appear harmless or even good, but lead hearts away from God. 
This reminds us to stay discerning and rooted in God’s Word. The enemy often disguises lies with a cloak of truth. As believers, we must test everything against Scripture and the Spirit’s guidance. The mark of the beast may symbolize allegiance to worldly systems rather than to Christ. Our calling is to remain true to the Lamb, even when deception surrounds us. 
Challenge: Ask God to sharpen your spiritual discernment. Where in your life do you need to be more alert to deception? 
Prayer: Lord, give me wisdom to discern truth from lies. Keep me faithful to the Lamb and help me not be deceived by the enemy’s disguises. 



DAY 22:			 THE LAMB AND THE 144,000 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 14:1–5. 
Learn by Heart: “These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth,” Revelation 14:4.
John saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion with 144,000 who bore His Father’s Name on their foreheads. They sang a new song that only they could learn. These people were described as pure, faithful, and truthful. They followed the Lamb wherever He went. What a powerful description of true discipleship! To follow Jesus means surrendering fully, even when the path is difficult. It means living with integrity, speaking truth, and keeping our devotion to Him unstained by the world. 
The 144,000 symbolize all those who are sealed and preserved by God in Christ. Their joy comes from belonging to Him and living in His presence. This vision encourages us to live faithfully, knowing that our reward is to stand with the Lamb one day and sing a new song of victory. 
Challenge: What does following the Lamb “wherever He goes” mean for you today in your daily choices? 
Prayer: Lord, help me to follow You wholeheartedly, without compromise. Seal me with Your Spirit and give me joy in walking closely with You. 

DAY 23: 			THE THREE ANGELS’ MESSAGES 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 14:6–13. 
Learn by Heart: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus,” Revelation 14:12. 
Three angels proclaim messages to the world: the first calls all to fear God and worship Him, the second warns of Babylon’s fall, and the third warns against worshiping the beast. These messages remind us that God’s mercy still reaches out to people, even in the last days. He desires worshippers who honor Him alone. 
The warning against Babylon reminds us that worldly systems built on pride and sin will collapse. The final warning shows the seriousness of our choices, whether to align with the beast or with Christ. For God’s people, this passage calls for endurance and faith. Even when the world mocks or persecutes us, we are to keep holding to Jesus. Our reward is promised: rest from our labors and the joy of God’s eternal presence. 
Challenge: Think about your worship today. Is it fully directed to God, or are there “Babylon’s” you need to let go of? 
Prayer: Lord, help me to worship You with all my heart. Give me endurance to keep my faith in Jesus and resist every false path. 

DAY 24: 				THE HARVEST OF THE EARTH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 14:14–20 
Learn by Heart: “Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe,” Revelation 14:15. 
John saw one like the Son of Man on a cloud with a sharp sickle in His hand. An angel cried out for Him to reap, for the earth’s harvest was ripe. This is a sobering picture of judgment and separation. The harvest reminds us that God’s patience has a limit. One day, the time will come for Him to act. For believers, the harvest is also a picture of hope, as Christ gathers His people into His kingdom. But for those who reject Him, the harvest brings judgment. 
This passage challenges us to live ready, with our hearts devoted to Christ, because the day of harvest will surely come. It also calls us to be active in the work of sharing the Gospel, so more people can be gathered into His kingdom before it’s too late. 
Challenge: Who in your life needs to hear about Jesus before the harvest comes? Pray for them and look for a chance to share. 
Prayer: Lord, keep me ready for Your harvest. Help me to live faithfully and to bring others into Your kingdom before the final day.

DAY 25: 			THE SONG OF MOSES AND THE LAMB 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 15:1–8 
Learn by Heart: “Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints,” Revelation 15:3. 
John saw a vision of those who had overcome the beast standing by a sea of glass, singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Their song was one of victory and praise, celebrating God’s mighty works and His justice. This moment shows us that even in the midst of trials and battles, the final word is always praise. God’s ways are just, even when we do not fully understand them. 
The saints rejoiced because God had proven Himself faithful and victorious over evil. This scene reminds us that worship is not just for after the battle is over, it is also what carries us through the battle. Singing praises lifts our faith, keeps our focus on God, and reminds us that He is King over every situation. 
Challenge: What song of praise can you sing today, even in the middle of your struggles? 
Prayer: Lord, I praise You for Your marvelous works. Teach me to lift my song of worship in victory, trusting Your justice and goodness.

DAY 26: 		THE SEVEN BOWLS OF GOD’S WRATH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 16:1–21 
Learn by Heart: “Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments,” Revelation 16:7.
John described the seven bowls of God’s wrath poured out on the earth; terrible sores, rivers turning to blood, scorching heat, darkness, and great earthquakes. These judgments remind us of God’s holiness and His intolerance of sin. While the details are frightening, the central truth is clear: God is righteous and just in all He does. 
Many hardened their hearts and still refused to repent, showing how sin blinds people. But God’s people can take comfort, because His wrath is not for those who belong to Christ. Jesus has already taken our judgment on the Cross. These passages remind us to live with urgency, praying and working so that others may turn to God before it’s too late. His justice will come, but His mercy is available today. 
Challenge: Who do you know that needs God’s mercy before judgment comes? Pray for them by name today. 
Prayer: Lord, thank You for saving me from wrath through Jesus. Help me to live faithfully and point others to Your mercy while there is still time.

DAY 27:			 THE FALL OF BABYLON 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 18:1–24. 
Learn by Heart: “Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils,” Revelation 18:2. 
Babylon represents the pride, wealth, and corruption of the world’s systems that stand against God. John saw its sudden fall: merchants, kings, and nations mourning the loss of riches and luxury. This chapter is a warning to us not to place our hope in the things of this world. Riches, power, and human achievements may seem strong, but they can collapse in a moment. 
God calls His people to “come out of her,” to separate themselves from sinful systems and not share in Babylon’s judgment. For believers, the fall of Babylon is both a warning and a comfort: a warning not to love the world, and a comfort that evil will not stand forever. God’s kingdom is eternal, while the kingdoms of this world will perish. 
Challenge: What “Babylon” in your life do you need to separate from that is, worldly habits, pride, or misplaced trust? 
Prayer: Lord, help me not to put my hope in worldly riches or systems. Keep me pure and set apart for Your eternal kingdom. 

DAY 28:		 THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 19:1–10. 
Learn by Heart: “Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb,” Revelation 19:9.
John heard the sound of a great multitude shouting, “Halleluia! For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.” Then he saw the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, a joyful feast where Christ is united with His Bride, the Church. What a picture of love and celebration! After all the trials, judgments, and battles described earlier, here we see the ultimate reward for God’s people; intimate fellowship with Christ forever. 
Just as a wedding is a time of joy and union, so the Marriage Supper represents our eternal union with Jesus. The Church is clothed in fine linen, symbolizing the righteousness we receive through Christ. This vision reminds us to live as a bride preparing for her groom—pure, faithful, and expectant. One day, the invitation will be fulfilled, and we will rejoice with Christ at His table. 
Challenge: How are you preparing your life today as the bride of Christ, waiting for His coming? 
Prayer: Lord, thank You for inviting me to Your Marriage Supper. Help me to live ready, pure, and joyful as I wait for Your return. 
DAY 29: 			THE RETURN OF CHRIST THE KING 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 19:11–21.
 Learn by Heart: “And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS,” Revelation 19:16. 
John saw heaven opened, and a white horse appeared. The rider is called Faithful and True. This is Jesus, returning as the conquering King. His eyes blaze with fire, and His robe is dipped in blood. Armies follow Him, but the battle is His alone. He strikes down nations with the Sword of His Mouth and rules with a rod of iron. This passage reminds us that Jesus is not just the gentle Shepherd but also the righteous Judge and mighty Warrior. His Second Coming will not be in weakness, but in glory and power. 
For believers, this is a day of hope and triumph, but for those who reject Him, it is a day of dread. Knowing that Christ will return should shape how we live: faithful, watchful and ready to welcome our King. 
Challenge: If Jesus returned today, would He find you ready? What needs to change in your walk with Him? 
Prayer: Lord Jesus, You are King of kings and Lord of lords. Keep me faithful and ready for Your glorious return.

DAY 30: 			THE NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH 
Scripture in Focus: Revelation 21:1–8. 
Learn by Heart: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain,” Revelation 21:4. 
John saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old had passed away. The holy city, the New Jerusalem, came down like a bride beautifully prepared for her husband. God Himself will dwell with His people, and every tear will be wiped away. No more death, no more pain, no more sorrow. What a promise! This vision gives us a picture of our eternal home, where brokenness and suffering are gone forever. 
For those who belong to Christ, this is the hope that carries us through trials. But the passage also warns that the unbelieving, fearful, and sinful will not share in this new creation. Heaven is prepared for those who are washed in the Lamb’s Blood. This gives us both comfort and urgency, to live faithfully and to point others to Christ before it is too late. 
Challenge: How does the promise of a new heaven and earth shape the way you face today’s struggles? 
Prayer: Lord, thank You for the promise of a new heaven and earth. Help me to hold on with hope and live faithfully until that day. 


MAY 2026
DAY 1: 				SURE FOUNDATION

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 18:2; Isaiah 28:16; Matthew 7:24-25; 1 Corinthians 3:11.

Learn by Heart: "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic,'' Isaiah 28:16 (NIV).

Just as a cornerstone is essential for the stability and strength of a building, so, too, is God's sure foundation essential for the security and well-being of His people. This sure foundation finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is described as the cornerstone in the New Testament. In Ephesians 2:20, we read that believers are "built on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, with Christ Jesus Himself, as the chief cornerstone." Christ is the solid rock upon which our faith is built, and those who place their trust in Him will never be disappointed or shaken.

As we build our lives on the sure foundation of Jesus Christ, we can have confidence and assurance in the face of life's uncertainties and challenges. The storms of life may come, but we are secure in Christ, knowing that He will never leave us nor forsake us (Matthew 28:20, Hebrews 13:5). When our lives are firmly rooted in Him, we can weather the storms with peace and trust, because He is our rock and refuge. Moreover, building on the sure foundation of Christ enables us to live with purpose and meaning. In Him, we find our identity and our calling, as well as the strength and resources to fulfill it. As we abide in Him and allow His Spirit to work in and through us, we bear fruit that brings glory to God and blesses others (John 15:5; Galatians 5:22-23). Our lives become a testimony to the transformative power of Christ and His sure foundation.

Challenge: Resist the temptations to build your life on the shifting sands of human wisdom or worldly pursuits but, instead, stand firm on the unshakeable truth of God's Word.

Prayer: Help me to build my life on Your unchanging truth and to rely on Your strength and Grace in all things.

DAY 2:			THE STRENGTH FOUND IN WAITING

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 62:5.

Learn by Heart: “My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him,” Psalm 62:5.

Waiting is never comfortable, yet it is often the place where God shapes our faith the most. The Psalmist instructs his soul to wait only upon God, showing that true rest and expectation are found in Him alone. Many rush ahead of God, because they fear that delay could eventually mean denial. Wisdom Nugget: “God’s delay is not God’s denial; it is His preparation for a greater manifestation.” A young tailor once hurried to complete a garment, skipping essential stitches to meet a deadline. On the first wear, the clothe tore, and his reputation suffered. If he had waited to finish well, the result would have endured. Likewise, when we wait on God, we allow Him to stitch our lives perfectly.  His blessings will never bring sorrow with them.

Consider a woman who waited many years for a child. People mocked her, but she held on to God’s promise. At the appointed time, she conceived and named her child “Testimony.” She later said, “Had I rushed for a shortcut, I would have missed God’s perfect plan.” Waiting on God does not waste time; it builds character, aligns our hearts with His will, and produces testimonies that last. To wait is to trust that God’s time is never too early nor too late.

Challenge: What areas of your life are you tempted to rush today? Choose to pause and pray instead. Patience in God’s plan today is the seed of tomorrow’s victory.

Prayer: Lord, teach me to wait on You with a quiet and trusting heart. Help me to embrace Your timing and to see delay as Your preparation for something greater. 



DAY 3: 			THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE

Scripture Focus: Psalm 81:13.
 
Learn by Heart: “Oh that my people would hearken unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!”  Psalm 81:13.

Obedience is the key that unlocks the fullness of God’s blessings. The Psalmist in (Psalm 81) expressed God’s yearning for His people to listen and walk in His ways. Many believers struggle, not because God’s hand is too short to bless, but because their ears are too deaf to obey. Wisdom Nugget: “Delayed obedience is disobedience, and partial obedience is no obedience at all.”

A young farmer once ignored his father’s advice to sow early before the rain. When he eventually planted late, the rain stopped earlier than expected, and his harvest was poor. Had he listened, his field would have flourished. Similarly, our lives flourish when we promptly obey God’s instructions. Obedience is not about convenience, but about trust — trusting that God’s ways are always higher and better than ours (Isaiah 55:8–9). What is the last instruction God gave you that you have delayed or ignored? Obedience, even when it is uncomfortable, opens the door to divine provision and protection.

Challenge: Take a step today to do what God has laid on your heart.

Prayer: Lord, give me a heart that delights in prompt and total obedience to Your word. Help me to walk in Your ways daily.


DAY 4:	                                       THE HOPE OF OUR CALLING
Scripture in Focus: Ephesians 1:18.

Learn by Heart:  “God is faithful by whom ye are called unto the fellowship of His son Jesus Christ our Lord”, I Corinthians I: 9.

I pray the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called  you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints. This statement is challenging us to pray, to meditate on God's word and focus on why our Lord Jesus saved us and the and blessing we inherit through our faith in Jesus Christ. God's calling is a heavenly one rooted in God's eternal plan and purpose for us.

The hope of our calling is tied to the riches of God’s glorious inheritance in the saints a treasure that awaits us in eternity. As Christians we must pray to understand the hope of your calling, asking God to enlighten the eyes of our heart. Believers must live with purpose, knowing our calling, is rooted in God’s eternal plan and purpose for our life. We must equally hold onto the hope of our calling, trusting that God will fulfill His promises and bring you into His glorious presence. 

Challenge: We are called to a life of purpose, hope and inheritance in Christ so must we trust that God’s plan for our life is best and He will guide us every step of the Way.

Prayer: Heavenly Father open my eyes of understanding to know purpose and inheritance in Christ that I believe.


DAY 5: 				THE BATTLE IS THE LORD’S

Scripture in Focus: Exodus 14:14; Psalm 46:1; 1 Samuel 17:47; 2 Chronicles 20:1-29.

Learn by Heart: "For the battle is not yours, but God's,'' 2 Chronicles 20:15(b) (NIV).

King Jehoshaphat faces a formidable enemy army. Instead of relying on his own strength or military prowess, he turns to the Lord in prayer and declares his dependence on God for deliverance. In response, the Lord assures him, "Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's" (2 Chronicles 20:15b). This declaration serves as a powerful reminder that ultimate victory belongs to the Lord, and He is faithful to fight on behalf of His people. When we acknowledge that the battle belongs to the Lord, it changes our perspective and posture in the midst of challenges. Instead of being consumed by fear or anxiety, we can rest in the assurance that God is in control and He will work out all things for our good. This truth empowers us to face trials with courage and confidence, knowing that we are not alone, but that the Almighty God is fighting on our behalf.

Besides, recognizing that the battle is of the Lord frees us from the burden of trying to achieve victory through our own efforts. We can release our grip on control and surrender to God's plan and timing, trusting that His ways are higher than ours and His purposes will prevail. As we yield to His leading and submit to His will, we experience the peace and freedom that come from placing our trust in Him completely.

Challenge: Trust in the Lord's provision and protection, even in the midst of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

Prayer: Give me the courage and faith to surrender my battle to You, Oh Lord.
		

DAY 6:		THE REWARD OF TRUSTING GOD

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 62:8.

Learn by Heart: “Trust in him at all times; pour out your hearts to him, for God is our refuge,” Psalms 62:8.

Life often places us at the crossroads, where our strength, wisdom, or resources seem inadequate. At such moments, trusting God becomes not only a command, but a lifeline. Trust is not the absence of fear; it is the decision to hold onto God’s promises, despite fear. An old farmer once said, “Faith is like planting a seed: you bury it, but you believe rain will come and life will spring forth.” In the same way, when we entrust our burdens to the Lord, we sow into His unfailing love, knowing that the harvest will come in due season.

Consider the story of a young boy whose kite got stuck on a tall tree. People mocked him for still holding the string, but he said, “Even if I don’t see the kite, I know it’s there.” Trust in God is like holding that string — even when you cannot see the outcome, your faith keeps you connected to His power. As one wisdom nugget says, “Trusting God is not a risk; it is the safest investment of life.” No storm can uproot a heart anchored in Him.

Challenge: What are you holding onto today that you need to hand over to God? Let go of fear, and let your trust become your testimony.

Prayer: Lord, teach me to trust You in all seasons and hold firmly to Your promises, even when the answers are not visible. 



DAY 7:				WHO IS A TRUE HELPER?

Scripture in Focus: Hebrew 13:5-6.

Learn by Heart: "And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever— the Spirit of truth,"  John 14:16-17a (NIV).

We are reminded of God's promise never to leave us nor forsake us. This assurance of His presence brings great comfort and strength, especially in times of difficulty and uncertainty. As believers, we take solace in knowing that we have a true helper in God, who is always by our side, guiding, comforting, and sustaining us. Scriptures reveal that God can never leave us alone in our journey of life. In John 14:16, 17, Jesus promises to send another advocate, the Holy Spirit, to help us and be with us forever. The Holy Spirit is our constant companion, empowering us to live victoriously and enabling us to fulfill the purposes for which God has called us.

The Holy Spirit, as our true helper, guides and comforts us individually but also empowers and unifies the Body of Christ—the Church. In 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, we learn about the various spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit bestows upon believers for our common good. These gifts enable us to minister effectively to one another and to build up the Body of Christ in love. The Holy Spirit equips us to bear witness to Jesus Christ and to share the Gospel with boldness and clarity. In Acts 1:8, Jesus promises that you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, enabling you to be His witnesses to the ends of the Earth. 

Challenge: Surrender to Him, allow Him to work through you for the glory of God.

Prayer: Lead me into all truth and empower me to live the life that honour and glorifies You.



DAY 8:			WALKING IN THE WAY OF THE CROSS

Scripture in Focus: Luke 9:23..

Learn by Heart: "Take up your cross daily and follow me," Luke 9:23(b).	

In the Christian faith, the concept of the Way of the Cross holds profound significance. It represents the journey that Jesus undertook, bearing the weight of the Cross, enduring suffering, humiliation and, ultimately, sacrifice for the redemption of humanity. As followers of Christ, we are called to walk in His footsteps, embracing the Cross, not just as a symbol of suffering, but as a path to spiritual transformation and eternal life.

Taking up our cross daily is not merely a physical act, but a spiritual one. It involves denying ourselves, surrendering our selfish desires, and aligning our will with God's. It requires us to embrace the challenges, trials, and hardships of life with faith and perseverance, knowing that through them, we grow stronger, wiser, and more reliant on God's grace. In a world that often promotes self-gratification and comfort above all else, the message of the Cross stands in stark contrast. It reminds us that true discipleship demands sacrifice and selflessness. It calls us to prioritize the kingdom of God above earthly pursuits, to love sacrificially, serve humbly, and forgive generously.

Challenge: Examine your life and identify areas where you need to die to self and live for Christ.

Prayer: Give me the strength to deny myself, take up my cross daily, and follow You wholeheartedly.


DAY 9:			KNOWING JESUS AS THE REAL LIFE

Scripture in Focus: John 11: 1-44.

Learn by Heart: "Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die,”   John 11:25-26 (NIV).

We witness one of the most profound miracles performed by Jesus—the raising of Lazarus from the dead. This miraculous event serves as a powerful illustration of Jesus as "the life." Jesus declares to Martha, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die" (John 11:25-26). As followers of Christ, we are called to embrace Jesus as the source of true life—both in this world and for eternity. He offers us not just existence, but abundant life—a life marked by purpose, meaning, and fulfillment. This life is not contingent on external circumstances but is rooted in our relationship with Jesus Christ, who is the source of all life.

Jesus as "the life" invites us into a dynamic and intimate relationship with Him. He desires to not only be our Savior but also our constant companion, guiding us, empowering us, and sustaining us through every season of life. As we abide in Him and draw near to Him, we experience the richness and fullness of life that He promises.

Challenge: Allow His life-giving presence to permeate every aspect of your existence, bringing healing, restoration and wholeness.

Prayer: May Your life continuously flow through me, bringing light to the darkness hanging over our world and hope to the hopeless. 


DAY 10:			KNOWING JESUS AS THE ONLY WAY 

Scripture in Focus: Act 9:1-9.

Learn by Heart: "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me," John 14:6 (NIV).

In Acts 9, we encounter the dramatic conversion of Saul, who later became known as the Apostle Paul. Saul was on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians when he encountered the risen Jesus. This encounter changed the trajectory of his life forever. Jesus revealed Himself to Saul as "the way," showing him that true life and purpose are found in following Him. In John 14:6, Jesus declares Himself to be "the way, the truth, and the life." These words are not merely a statement of His identity; they are a profound revelation of His mission and purpose. Jesus is the exclusive path to God, the embodiment of truth, and the source of abundant life.

As the Way, Jesus provides the means for us to be reconciled to God. Through His sacrificial death on the Cross, He made a way for sinful humanity to be forgiven and restored to fellowship with God. He invites us to follow Him, to walk in His footsteps, and to experience the fullness of life that He offers. Aside, Jesus is the truth, revealing to us the reality of God's love, grace, and redemption. In a world filled with lies and deception, His words are a beacon of light, guiding us in the paths of righteousness. As we abide in His truth, we are set free from the bondage of sin and error. Jesus as "the way" implies a journey - a lifelong journey of discipleship and transformation. It's not enough to simply acknowledge Jesus as the way; we must actively follow Him, allowing His teachings to shape our thoughts, words, and actions. 

Challenge:  Let’s share the Good News of Jesus with others, inviting them to experience the abundant life found in Him.

Prayer: Help me to follow Christ faithfully, trusting in His guidance and surrendering all to You.
	


DAY 11:	UNDERSTANDING JESUS AS “THE TRUTH”

Scripture in Focus: John 18:33-38.

Learn by Heart: "Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free," John 8:32 (NIV).
	
Jesus stands before Pilate, who questions Him about His identity and authority. In response, Jesus declares that He came into the world to bear witness to the truth. Pilate responds with the famous question, "What is truth?"  Truth is not merely a set of facts or propositions; it is a person - Jesus Christ Himself. He is the embodiment of truth, the ultimate standard of righteousness and authenticity. In a world marked by deception and relativism, Jesus stands as a beacon of light, shining forth the truth of God's love, grace, and redemption.

As followers of Christ, we are called to not only embrace the truth, but also to embody it in our lives. This means living with integrity, honesty, and transparency, even when it's difficult or unpopular. It means standing firm in our convictions and speaking the truth in love, even in the face of opposition or persecution. When we walk in the truth, we reflect the character of our Savior and bear witness to His transformative power in our lives.

Challenge: Cultivate a spirit of discernment, testing everything against the standard of God's truth.

Prayer: Give me discerning heart to recognize and embrace Your truth, and empower me to share it boldly with others. 


DAY 12:		  THE POWER IN “THE WORD”

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 119:105.

Learn by Heart: "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path,"  Psalm 119:105 (ESV).

Psalm 119:105 beautifully captures the essence of the Word of God. It serves as a lamp to illuminate our path and a light to guide our steps in the journey of life. Just as a lamp dispels darkness and reveals hidden obstacles, the Word of God shines brightly in the darkness of this world, revealing truth, wisdom, and direction to all who seek it. The Word of God is not merely a collection of ancient writings; it is the living and active revelation of God Himself. It contains everything we need and godliness, offering comfort, encouragement, correction, and instruction in righteousness. It reveals to us the character of God, the nature of His kingdom, and His redemptive plan for humanity.

The Word of God is not merely a book of information; it is a revelation of God's heart, His will, and His purposes for humanity. It reveals to us the story of redemption, beginning with creation and culminating in the glorious return of Christ. As we immerse ourselves in the pages of the Scripture, we encounter the living God, who speaks to us through its timeless truths. In all, the Word of God is a powerful weapon in the spiritual battles we face. It is described as the sword of the Spirit in Ephesians 6:17, capable of demolishing strongholds and defeating the enemy's schemes. 

Challenge: Let's allow the Word to be our guide, our source of wisdom, and our anchor in the storms of life. 

Prayer: Thank You for the gift of Your Word, the lamp to my feet and a light to my path. Help me to treasure Your word in my heart and to live according to its truth.


DAY 13:			                  WAITING FOR GOD'S TIME

Scripture in Focus: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.

Learn by Heart: "He has made everything beautiful in its time," Ecclesiastes 3:11(a)	

In a world obsessed with instant gratification and quick results, it's easy to become frustrated when things don't happen in line with our timetable. However, Ecclesiastes 3 reminds us that there is a time and season for everything under heaven. God's timing is not bound by our clocks or calendars; it operates according to His perfect plan and purpose. When we trust in God's timing, we open ourselves to His divine orchestration of events in our lives. We may not always understand why things happen the way they do, but we can be rest assured that God's timing is always right. His timing is marked by beauty, bringing about the perfect alignment of circumstances for His glory and our good.

When we align ourselves with His timing, we experience His best for us. Sometimes, we may feel impatient or anxious, wanting things to happen according to our schedule. However, God's timing is far superior to ours. He knows the perfect moment for every blessing, breakthrough, and opportunity in our lives. God's time is marked by beauty, where every delay, every setback, and every waiting period is part of His grand design. His timing is not bound by our impatience or limited perspective; rather, it unfolds according to His eternal purposes. When we align our lives with God's timing, we step into the rhythm of His grace, experiencing the fullness of His blessings and provision.

Challenge: Challenge yourself to surrender your schedules and agendas to God's timing. 

Prayer: Gracious God, teach me to trust in Your perfect timing, even when I am tempted to doubt or grow impatient. 


DAY 14:			GIVING ALL FOR JESUS

Scripture in Focus: Mark 8:34-38.

Learn by Heart: "Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: 'Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me,” Mark 8:34.

Jesus lays out the fundamental requirement of discipleship: Total surrender. He calls us to:
i.	Deny ourselves;
ii.	Take up our cross; and 
iii.	Follow Him. 
This radical call to discipleship challenges us to prioritize Jesus above all else. It's a call to relinquish our own desires, ambitions, and comforts, and to embrace His will wholeheartedly. In Philippians 1:21, Apostle Paul summarises the essence of living a life completely surrendered to Jesus Christ. He declares that his entire existence is centered around Christ, with every thought, word, and action directed towards glorifying Him. When we live all for Jesus, we embrace a life of purpose, significance, and eternal value. Our focus shifts from self-centered pursuits to the exaltation of Christ, finding our ultimate satisfaction in Him alone.

Living all for Jesus means making Him the center of our lives. It means allowing His love, grace, and truth to permeate every aspect of who we are. It's about aligning our thoughts, words, and actions with His teachings and example. When we live all for Jesus, we experience the joy of knowing Him intimately and the fulfillment of walking in obedience to His word.

Challenge: Prayerfully seek His guidance and grace to surrender everything to Him afresh.

Prayer: I surrender myself to You once again, asking for Your grace to help me deny myself, take up my cross, and follow You wholeheartedly.


DAY 15:				IN THE BEGINNING

Scripture in Focus: Genesis 1:1.

Learn by Heart: "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth," Genesis 1:1 (NIV).

Genesis 1 marks the beginning of God's grand narrative of creation. In these simple, yet profound, words, we are introduced to the Creator who spoke the universe into existence out of nothing. Before time began, before the world came into being, God existed, sovereign and supreme over all. "In the beginning" signifies not just the start of the physical universe, but the inauguration of God's divine plan for creation. It speaks of order emerging from chaos, light piercing through darkness, and life bursting forth from nothingness. It reminds us that our existence is not a random accident, but a deliberate act of divine craftsmanship.

As we reflect on the opening words of Scripture, we are invited to marvel at the wonder and majesty of God's creative power. We see His wisdom displayed in the intricacies of nature, His goodness evident in the provision of all things, and His love demonstrated in the gift of life itself. There is an intimate relationship between the Creator (God) and His creation. We are not the product of blind chance or random processes; we are the deliberate handiwork of a loving and purposeful God. Our existence finds meaning and significance in being created in the image of God, designed for fellowship with Him and to fulfill His divine purpose.

Challenge: Let's challenge ourselves to reflect on the significance of "In the beginning" in our lives.

Prayer: Help me to trust in Your sovereignty and to submit to Your will in all things.



DAY 16:				OUR CITY OF ORIGIN

Scripture in Focus: Philippians 3:20.

Learn by Heart: "But our citizenship is in heaven," Philippians 3:20(a).

In a world often characterized by divisions, conflicts, and disparities, it's easy to become consumed by the concerns of our earthly city. However, as followers of Christ, we are reminded that our ultimate citizenship lies not in the temporal cities of this world, but in the eternal city of heaven. This truth transforms our perspective and shapes our priorities as we navigate the complexities of life on earth.

As citizens of heaven, we are called to live with a sense of anticipation and expectancy, eagerly awaiting the return of our Saviour, Jesus Christ. This anticipation fuels our hope, sustains our faith, and empowers us to live with purpose. It reminds us that our true home is not found in the material possessions or accomplishments of this world, but in the presence of God Himself. Understanding our citizenship in heaven also frees us from the entanglements of earthly pursuits and desires (Matthew 6:33). While it's important to be engaged citizens in our earthly communities, we are called to prioritize the values and principles of God's kingdom above all else (Matthew 6:33). This means loving our neighbors, seeking justice and mercy, and extending grace and compassion to all that we encounter.

Challenge: Examine your hearts and minds, surrendering any attachments or distractions that hinder your pursuit of God's kingdom.

Prayer: Strengthen my faith, deepen my unity with others, and empower me to live the life that honours and glorifies Your Name.



DAY 17:			THE IMPORTANCE OF OBEDIENCE

Scripture in Focus: 1 Samuel 15:1-22.

Learn by Heart: "To obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams," 1 Samuel 15:22(b).

Obedience lies at the heart of our relationship with God. Obedience is more pleasing to God than religious rituals or outward displays of piety. God desires hearts that are fully surrendered to His will and obedient to His commands. When we obey God, we demonstrate our love for Him and acknowledge His rightful authority over our lives. Throughout Scriptures, we see the importance of obedience in the lives of God's people. From Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac to Jesus' submission to the Father's will in the Garden of Gethsemane, obedience is a recurring theme that marks the lives of those who walk closely with God. As followers of Christ, we are called to follow His example of obedience, even when it requires sacrifice or goes against our own desires.

Obedience is a key component of our spiritual growth and maturity. As we obey God's Word and follow His leading, we become more conformed to the image of Christ. In John 14:15 (KJV), Jesus says, "If ye love me, keep my commandments." Our obedience is an expression of our love for God and a demonstration of our desire to walk in intimacy with Him. The more we obey Him, the more we experience His presence, His peace, and His power. Let us, therefore, make obedience a priority, seeking to honour God in all that we do. 

Challenge: Choose to surrender your will to His and trust in His wisdom and goodness, knowing that His plans for you are always for our welfare and not for harm (Jeremiah 29:11).

Prayer: May my life be a testimony to the power of obedience and the blessings that come from walking in fellowship with God.


DAY 18:			THE POWER OF THE TONGUE

Scripture in Focus: Proverbs 15:4; Matthew 12:36-37; Colossians 4:6.

Learn by Heart: "Death and life are in the power of the tongue," Proverbs 18:21(a).

The tongue is a small member of the body, yet it holds incredible power. Our words have the ability to build up or tear down, to encourage or discourage, to bless or curse. Therefore, it is essential that we use our words wisely and responsibly, recognizing the impact they can have on others and on ourselves. Throughout Scriptures, we see numerous warnings and exhortations regarding the tongue and its potential for harm. James 3:5-6 describes the tongue as a small spark that can set a forest ablaze, causing great destruction. Similarly, Ephesians 4:29 instructs believers to speak only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may impart grace to those who hear.

Our words not only have the power to impact others, but also to shape our own lives and destinies. Proverbs 18:20 says, "A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled." This verse highlights the principle of sowing and reaping with our words. When we speak words of faith and hope, we are sowing seeds that will produce a harvest of blessing and fulfillment. Conversely, when we speak words of doubt and fear, we are sowing seeds that will lead to dissatisfaction and lack.

Challenge: Resist the temptation to gossip, slander, or speak negatively about others, and instead, let us seek to build others up and encourage them.

Prayer: Guard my tongue from speaking evil or causing harm, and help me to speak only what is pleasing in Your sight.


DAY 19:					IN HIS NAME

Scripture in Focus: Acts 3:16; Philippians 2:9-11; Colossians 3:17; James 5:14-15.

Learn by Heart: "That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth, and things under the earth," Philippians 2:10.

The Name of Jesus holds incomparable power and authority. God exalted Jesus to the highest place and bestowed upon Him a Name that is above every other name. At the mention of His name, every knee bows and every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord. This truth underscores the supremacy of Jesus Christ and His sovereignty over all creation. As believers, we have been given the privilege and responsibility to invoke the Name of Jesus in our prayers, our worship, and our daily life. The Name of Jesus is not merely a religious symbol or a ritualistic formula but a powerful declaration of His lordship and authority. When we pray in the Name of Jesus, we are invoking His authority and inviting His presence to move in our midst.

The Name of Jesus is not only powerful in prayer and spiritual warfare, but also transformative. When we live in alignment with His Name and character, we reflect His love, grace, and compassion to those around us. As followers of Christ, we are called to bear His Name with honour and integrity, demonstrating His kingdom values and principles in all that we do. Our words and actions should be a testimony to the power of His Name to bring about redemption, reconciliation, and restoration.

Challenge: I choose to pray boldly and confidently in the Name of Jesus, knowing that His Name has the power to heal the sick, to cast out demons, and to break every chain of bondage 

Prayer: May I pray and worship in Your Name, knowing that You have the power to save, to heal, and to deliver.



DAY 20;			THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 23:1-6.

Learn by Heart: "The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing," Psalm 23:1 (NIV).

In Psalm 23, we are reminded that the Lord is our shepherd, and because of His care, we lack nothing. This powerful imagery of God as our shepherd speaks of His intimate knowledge of our needs and His tender care for His flock. Just as a shepherd leads his sheep to green pastures and still waters, God guides us along paths of righteousness, providing rest and refreshment for our souls. Even in the midst of life's darkest valleys, we can take comfort in the presence of our Shepherd. His rod and staff serve as symbols of protection and guidance, reassuring us that we need not fear any evil, for He is with us. His presence brings us comfort and peace, even in the face of adversity.

The image of a table prepared before us in the presence of our enemies speaks to God's provision and abundance in the midst of opposition. Even when surrounded by challenges and obstacles, God's blessings overflow in our lives, filling us with gratitude and joy. His anointing oil symbolizes His blessing and favour upon us, pouring out His Grace and mercy abundantly. Surely, goodness and mercy will follow us all the days of our lives as we trust in the Lord and walk in His ways. His unfailing love surrounds us, guiding us through life's ups and downs and leading us to our eternal home in His presence. 

Challenge: Live each day with gratitude and joy, knowing that we are deeply loved and cherished by our Shepherd.

Prayer: Thank You for being my Good Shepherd who cares for me with unwavering love and compassion.


DAY 21:				IN TIMES LIKE THIS

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 46:1-10.

Learn by Heart: "God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble," Psalm 46:1 (NIV).

In times of uncertainty, fear, and turmoil, the words of Psalm 46 offer comfort and reassurance to the souls. The Psalmist reminds us that God is our refuge and strength, a constant presence in the midst of life's storms. When the world around us seems to be falling apart, we can take refuge in the unchanging character of our God, who is sovereign over all creation. The imagery of mountains trembling and waters roaring conveys the magnitude of life’s challenges. Yet, even in the face of such chaos, we need not fear, for our God is greater than any obstacle or adversity. His power is unmatched, His love unfailing, and His presence ever near. Therefore, we can rest secure in the knowledge that He is with us, guiding us through the darkest valleys and leading us to still waters.

As we meditate on the words of Psalm 46, we are reminded of the peace that comes from knowing that God is in control. He is the one who calms the nations, brings an end to wars, and establishes His kingdom of righteousness and justice. In the midst of the chaos and turmoil of this world, He calls us to be still and know that He is God, exalted above all else. The call to "be still" is not a passive resignation to circumstances but a deliberate act of faith and trust in God's sovereignty. It requires us to quiet our hearts and minds, relinquishing our anxieties and fears, and resting in the assurance of God's presence and power. In the stillness, we find strength, clarity, and renewed hope in God’s promises.

Challenge: Be a source of comfort and hope to those around you, pointing them to God’s unchanging love and faithfulness.

Prayer: May Your peace that surpasses all understanding guard my heart and mind in Christ Jesus.


DAY 22:			WHERE IS YOUR INTEGRITY?

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 25:21; Proverbs 10:22; 11:3; Titus 2:7-8.

Learn by Heart: "The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity," Proverb 11:3 (NIV).

Integrity is a virtue that is highly valued in the sight of God and is essential for living to honours Him. Proverbs 11:3 tells us that the integrity of the upright guides them, serving as a moral compass that directs their thoughts, words, and actions. Integrity is about being honest and upright in all our dealings, even when no one is watching, because we recognize that God sees and knows all things. Integrity is not just about external actions; it begins in the heart. Proverbs 4:23 admonishes us to "above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it." When our hearts are filled with integrity, our words and deeds will naturally align with God's truth and righteousness. It requires constant vigilance and a commitment to nurture a heart that is pure and steadfast in its devotion to God.

Integrity is a witness to the world of the transforming power of the Gospel. We demonstrate to others the reality of our faith and the goodness of our God. In Matthew 5:16, Jesus tells us, "Let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven." Our integrity has the potential to draw others to Christ and to point them to the abundant life found in Him.

Challenge: Commit to be a person of honesty, transparency, and reliability, knowing that our integrity reflects our identity as followers of Christ.

Prayer: Help me to walk in Your footsteps, living in honesty, integrity, and uprightness in all that I do.


DAY 23:			SURELY; HE IS COMING BACK

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 24:44; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Titus 2:13; Revelation 22:20.

Learn by Heart: "'Yes, I am coming soon.' Amen. Come, Lord Jesus," Revelation 22:20(b)

The promise of Christ's return is a central theme throughout The Bible, and it serves as a source of hope and encouragement for believers. In Revelation 22:20, Jesus Himself declares, "Yes, I am coming soon." These words remind us that the culmination of God's redemptive plan is the return of Christ to establish His kingdom on Earth and to reign in righteousness and glory forever. As we await the return of Christ, let us also be mindful of the signs of the times and the urgency of the Gospel message. In Matthew 24:14, Jesus declares, "And this Gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." Our task as believers is to be faithful witnesses of the Gospel, proclaiming the Good News of salvation to all people, so that none may perish but all may come to repentance.

The promise of Christ's Coming is not just a future hope, but a present reality that should impact how we live today. In 2 Peter 3:11-12, we are reminded, "Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming." Therefore, let us strive to live to please God, in holiness, righteousness and love for others.

Challenge: Determine to live with a sense of urgency and anticipation of Christ's Coming.

Prayer: Help me to live with a sense of anticipation and readiness for Your return, keeping watch and being vigilant in faith.


DAY 24:			THE RESURRECTION POWER

Scripture in Focus: Ephesians 1:19-20.

Learn by Heart: "And His incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead," Ephesians 1:20.

The resurrection power of Jesus Christ is the pinnacle of God's redemptive plan and the foundation of our faith as believers. Apostle Paul prays that believers would grasp the incomparably great power that is at work within them—the same power that raised Christ from the dead and exalted Him to the highest place. This resurrection power is not merely a historical event, but a present reality that empowers believers to live victorious life and to fulfill God's purposes on Earth. Christ’s resurrection power is a demonstration of God's sovereignty over sin, death, and the powers of darkness. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus conquered sin and death once and for all, offering forgiveness and eternal life to all who believe in Him (Romans 6:9-10). This victory over sin and death is the foundation of our hope as Christians, assuring us of our salvation and our future resurrection to eternal life with God.

This power assures us of victory over sin and death; likewise it empowers us to live a transformed life. As believers, we are called to walk in newness of life, no longer enslaved to the patterns of this world, but transformed by the renewing of our minds (Romans 6:4, 12:2). The same power that raised Jesus from the dead enables us to overcome sin and to live in righteousness and holiness before God (1 Peter 1:3-4).

Challenge: Let us not be content with merely existing as Christians, but let us strive to live in the fullness of Christ’s resurrection power, walking in obedience and bearing fruit that glorifies His Name (John 15:5).

Prayer: Heavenly Father, I thank you for Christ’s he resurrection power available to me.
.	

DAY 25:				WORKING FOR GOD

Scripture in Focus: Proverbs 16:3; Ephesians 6:7; Colossians 3:23-24; 1 Corinthians 10:31.

Learn by Heart: "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters," Colossians 3:23 (NIV).

In Colossians 3:23, 24, we are reminded of the importance of working with excellence and diligence in everything we do, recognizing that, ultimately, we are working for the Lord Himself. This truth transforms our perspective on work, elevating it from merely a means of earning a living to a sacred act of worship and service to God. Whether our work is in the marketplace, the home, or the church, we are called to approach it with dedication, integrity and a desire to honour God in all things.

As followers of Christ, our work is not separate from our faith but an integral part of it. Our vocations and occupations are opportunities to glorify God and advance His kingdom on Earth. Whether we are teachers, doctors, engineers, or homemakers, we have been entrusted with unique talents and abilities that we can use to make a difference in the lives of others and to bring glory to God.  As we work for God, it is important to remember that our labour is not in vain. In 1 Corinthians 15:58, we are encouraged to "always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain." Even when our efforts may seem insignificant or unnoticed by others, God sees and values every act of service done with a pure heart and sincere devotion to Him.

Challenge: Be mindful of the impact your work can have on those around you, using our influence and resources to bless others and to advance God's kingdom.

Prayer: Help me to approach my tasks with diligence and integrity, knowing that I am working for You, not for human masters.


DAY 26:			THE CREATOR AND HIS CREATION

Scripture in Focus: Genesis 1:1-2, Psalm 24:1, Colossians 1:16, and Revelation 4:11.

Learn by Heart: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth," Genesis 1:1.

The opening words of The Bible, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth," set the foundation for our understanding of God as the Creator of all things. In Genesis 1, we witness the majestic act of creation unfolding before our eyes, as God speaks the world into existence out of nothingness. From the vast expanse of the heavens to the intricate details of the earth, every aspect of creation reflects the wisdom, power, and creativity of its Maker. As we contemplate the beauty and wonder of God's creation, we are reminded of His sovereignty over all things. The same God who spoke the universe into being is the one who sustains it by His power and providence. From the smallest blade of grass to the mightiest mountain, every creature and every element of nature bears the imprint of its Creator, declaring His glory and majesty.

In Psalm 19:1 "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." Indeed, creation serves as a powerful testament to the existence and character of God. As we marvel at the beauty of a sunrise or the intricate design of a flower, we catch a glimpse of the infinite wisdom and creativity of the One who made it all. God's creation also reflects His love and care for humanity. In Genesis 1:26-27, God created humankind in His own image, male and female He created them. This profound truth affirms the inherent dignity and worth of every human being, as well as our special relationship with our Creator. We are not mere accidents of evolution, but intentional creations of a loving and purposeful God.

Challenge: Let us commit to caring for the Earth and all its inhabitants, recognizing that they are precious gifts entrusted to us by God, our Creator. 

Prayer: May I be good stewards of the Earth and all its inhabitants, reflecting Your love and creativity in all that I do.


DAY 27:				WALKING WITH GOD

Scripture in Focus: Genesis 5:24; Genesis 6:9, Micah 6:8, Hebrews 11:5.

Learn by Heart: "To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God," Micah 6:8b (NIV).

The call to walk humbly with God is a central theme throughout Scripture, reflecting the desire of our Creator for a close and intimate relationship with His people. In Micah 6:8, we are reminded of the simplicity and beauty of God's requirements for His followers: to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with Him. This verse describes what it means to live a life that pleases God and honours His kingdom. To walk with God is to submit to his leadership and guidance in all things. It involves a commitment to righteousness and justice, standing up for what is right and advocating for the oppressed and marginalized. It means extending mercy and grace to others, just as God has shown mercy and grace to us. It requires humility, recognizing our dependence on God and our need for His guidance and direction in all things.

Walking with God is not just about our outward actions but about the condition of our hearts. It requires us to cultivate a deep and abiding love for God, seeking His presence and fellowship above all else. It involves surrendering our own desires and ambitions, and submitting to His will. When we walk humbly with God, we invite Him to be Lord of all, guiding us in the paths of righteousness and leading us to abundant life.

Challenge: Let us challenge ourselves to walk humbly with God in all things.

Prayer: Help me to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with You in all that I do.


DAY 28:				FIGHTING AGAINST THE FLESH

Scripture in Focus: Galatians 5:16-17; Romans 8:5-8.

Learn by Heart: "So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh," Galatians 5:16-17 (NIV).

Apostle Paul highlights the ongoing battle between the flesh and the Spirit that every believer faces. The flesh represents our sinful nature, with its desires and inclinations that are contrary to God's will. On the other hand, the Spirit represents the indwelling presence of God in of believers, empowering them to live holy and righteous lives. These two forces are in constant conflict, The war against the flesh is a daily struggle that requires vigilance and perseverance. As believers, we are called to put to death the deeds of the flesh and to live according to the Spirit (Romans 8:13). This requires a deliberate effort to crucify our sinful desires and to surrender our will to the leading of the Holy Spirit. It means saying No to the temptations of the flesh and saying Yes to the ways of God, even when it is difficult or unpopular.

In Ephesians 6:12, we are reminded that our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Therefore, we must arm ourselves with the armour of God, standing firm in the truth, righteousness, faith, and salvation that Christ provides. Through prayer and reliance on the Word of God, we can resist the schemes of the enemy and walk in victory over the flesh.

Challenge: Challenge yourself to consciously walk by the Spirit all the time.

Prayer: Give me the strength to resist the desires of the flesh and to live in obedience to Your commands.

DAY 29:			OBEDIENCE TO TITHING
	
Scripture in Focus: Genesis 14:18-20; Malachi 3:8-12.

Learn by Heart: "Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,…," Malachi 3:10.

Throughout The Bible, we see examples of individuals who honored God with their tithes and experienced His faithfulness in return. Abraham, the father of faith, gave a tithe of all he had to Melchizedek, the Priest of the Most High (Genesis 14:18-20). Jacob vowed to give a tenth of all his possessions to God after encountering Him at Bethel (Genesis 28:20-22). Jesus commended the widow who gave all she had, emphasizing the importance of giving from the heart (Mark 12:41-44). Tithing is not about meeting a quota or fulfilling an obligation but about acknowledging God as the source of all our blessings and trusting Him to provide for our needs. When we tithe faithfully, we partner with God and demonstrate our commitment to His kingdom purposes. Tithing is an act of stewardship, recognizing that everything we have belongs to God and that we are merely stewards of His resources.

Tithing is an act of trust in God's provision. By giving a portion of our income back to God, we acknowledge that He is the ultimate source of all our blessings and that He is faithful to provide for our needs. It challenges us to step out in faith, believing that God will honour His promise to bless those who give faithfully. Tithing deepens our dependence on Him and trust in His abundant supply, which assures we lack nothing.

Challenge: Do not give out of compulsion or obligation, but out of a cheerful heart that recognizes God's goodness and provision in your life.

Prayer: Use my tithes to further your kingdom work and to bless those in need.


DAY 30:			JESUS AS THE LIVING WATER

Scripture in Focus: John 4:5-14

Learn by Heart: "But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life," John 4:14.

Jesus meets a Samaritan woman at a well and offers her living water. This encounter transcends mere physical thirst; it addresses the deepest longings of the human soul. Just as Jesus offered living water to the Samaritan woman, He offers the same to each of us today. This living water isn't just a temporary fix; it's an eternal solution to the emptiness and dissatisfaction that plague each one.
The living water that Jesus offers isn't drawn from a physical well; it flows from His very being; it nourishes our spirit and offers abundant life. It satisfies our deepest desires and provides us with an unending source of joy, peace, and fulfillment. 

This living water isn't dependent on external circumstances; like dry season, for instance; it's a constant, ever-flowing stream of Grace that sustains us in every season of life. To drink from this well, we come to Jesus with a hunger and a thirst. That way, we find satisfaction and fulfillment. It involves seeking intimacy with Christ through prayer, worship, and the study of His Word. As we drink deeply from His well, we find ourselves transformed from the inside out, overflowing with His love and Grace.

Challenge: Let's not settle for the temporary pleasures that the world offers, but instead, seek the eternal satisfaction found in Christ alone.

Prayer: Thank You for the living water that You offer to me through Your Son, Jesus Christ. Fill me afresh with Your Spirit today. 


DAY 31:	KNOWING JESUS AS THE BREAD OF LIFE

Scripture in Focus: John 6:25-35.

Learn by Heart: "Then Jesus declared, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty,'"  John 6:35.

Jesus proclaims Himself as the "bread of life," a profound statement that goes beyond mere physical sustenance. Just as bread sustains our physical bodies, Jesus sustains our spirit, providing nourishment, satisfaction and eternal life. This declaration reveals Jesus as the source of our deepest satisfaction and the solution to our spiritual hunger and thirst. Feeding on the bread of life requires a deliberate choice on our part. It entails seeking intimacy with Jesus through prayer, worship, and the study of His word. It involves surrendering our own desires and priorities to His will, allowing Him to fill us with His love and Grace. As we daily spend quality time with Him, we become more and more like Him in character and conduct.

As the bread of life, Jesus offers Himself freely to all who come to Him in faith. He satisfies the hunger of our souls, filling the emptiness within us with His love, Grace, and truth. Just as bread sustains our bodies, Jesus sustains our spirit, offering us sustenance that goes beyond the temporary pleasures of this world. He is the bread that satisfies our deepest longings and brings us abundant life.
The invitation to partake of the bread of life is open to all irrespective of social status, ethnicity, or past mistakes. Jesus welcomes all who come to Him with open arms, offering them the gift of eternal life and intimate fellowship with God, the Father.

Challenge: Spend time in His presence, feed on His word; and allow His Spirit to fill you with His love and Grace.

Prayer: Fill me anew with Your Spirit today, satisfy the hunger of my soul and quench my thirst for Your presence. Help me to feast on Your Word and to walk in intimate fellowship with You each day.

JUNE 2026

DAY1:					THE BEREAN BELIEVERS

Scripture in Focus: Acts 17:11.

Learn by Heart: “Study to show yourself approved unto God, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth,” 2 Timothy 2:15.

A “Berean believer” is a Christian who values and examines God’s Word with an eager heart. The believers in Berea were described as noble, because they didn’t just accept Paul’s preaching blindly — they searched the Scriptures daily to confirm the truth. This attitude made them spiritually strong and grounded in the Faith. Today, many Christians rely only on what they hear from others without checking if it aligns with The Bible. But God desires that we, like the Bereans, study His Word ourselves. A “Berean believer” does not follow people, but follows Scriptures. They allow the Holy Spirit to guide them into the truth and deepen their understanding of God’s will.

Studying the Word daily helps us grow in wisdom, avoid deception, and live by truth. In a world filled with false teachings and distractions, being a “Berean believer” keeps us anchored in Christ. When we examine the Word regularly, we become stronger in faith, clearer in purpose, and more discerning about what pleases God.

Challenge:
Don’t depend solely on what others say about The Bible. Take time each day to read, study, and confirm the truth for yourself. Be a “Berean believer” who lives by the Word, not by opinion.

Prayer: Lord, give me the desire and discipline to study Your Word daily.


DAY 2:				 THE GOD OF TIME AND SEASON

Scripture in Focus: Ecclesiastes 3:1. 

Learn by Heart: “And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding,” Daniel 2:21. 

God is the master of time and seasons. He created time and determines the purpose for every moment under heaven. While humans often rush and grow impatient, God’s timing is always perfect. He knows the right season for every event in our lives, and nothing happens by accident. Sometimes we think God is slow, but He is never late. Joseph waited years before his dream was fulfilled, and Abraham waited decades before receiving his promise. Their patience proved that when God’s time comes, His purpose cannot be hindered.

Delays are not denials — they are often God’s way of preparing us for greater blessings. When we trust Him, we learn that every season — whether joyful or painful — serves a divine purpose. So, rest in God’s timing, knowing He makes all things beautiful in His time (Ecclesiastes 3:11).

Challenge: Are you waiting for something? Trust God’s perfect timing. Don’t be discouraged; your appointed season will surely come.

Prayer: Father, let every season of my life bring glory to Your Name.


DAY 3:			 MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE (PART 1)

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 4:4; Deuteronomy 8:3; John 6:35. 

Learn by Heart: “ ......I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food,” Job 23:12.

When Jesus said, “Man shall not live by bread alone,” He reminded us that life is more than physical survival. Bread represents the basic needs of life, but true living comes from God’s Word. The Word nourishes our spirit and gives direction, peace, and strength in every situation. When tempted by the devil, Jesus chose the Word over hunger. This shows us that obedience to God’s Word is more important than satisfying temporary desires. Many feed their bodies daily, but starve their souls. Just as food sustains the body, God’s Word sustains the spirit.

If we desire to grow spiritually, we must make time for the Word daily. It renews our minds, builds our faith, and keeps us close to God. Only then can we live a balanced and fulfilled life.

Challenge: Don’t feed your body while you starve  your spirit. Make the Word of God your daily bread, and let it guide your thoughts and actions.

Prayer:  Lord, give me hunger for Your Word above all else.


DAY 4:		MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE (PART 2)

Scripture in Focus: John 6:63; Luke 10:42; Psalm 119:105. 

Learn by Heart:  “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,” Matthew 4:4.  

Yesterday, we learnt that man cannot survive on physical food alone, but needs the Word of God for true life. Today, we are reminded that spiritual nourishment is not a one-time meal — it is a daily necessity. The more we feed on God’s Word, the more alive our spirit becomes. Jesus said His words are spirit and life, meaning they carry divine energy that strengthens our inner being. While physical bread sustains the body temporarily, the Word of God sustains both body and soul eternally. Mary chose to sit at Jesus’ feet and listen to His Word, while Martha was busy with many things. Jesus commended Mary, showing us that listening to the Word is more valuable than worrying about daily needs.

God’s Word also gives direction. The Psalmist said it lights our path, guiding us away from sin and confusion. Without the Word, life becomes dark, restless, and empty — no matter how full our stomachs may be. So, don’t only feed your body with food; feed your soul with the Word. Read, meditate, and act upon it daily, and you will experience the fullness of life that bread alone can never give.

Challenge: Spend time every day reading and reflecting on God’s Word before you begin your daily activities. Let His Word shape your thoughts and choices.

Prayer: Lord, make me hunger for Your Word more than physical food. Help me to live daily by Your truth and find lasting satisfaction in Your presence.


 DAY 5:				 BE SAVED AND BE SAFE

Scripture in Focus: Psalm 91:1; Proverbs 18:10; John 10:28. 

Learn by Heart: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,” Acts 4:12.

Salvation is not just an escape from sin—it is also a place of safety. To be saved is to be secure in God’s hands. In this world of danger, fear, and uncertainty, true safety cannot be found in money, power, or protection systems; it is found in Christ alone. When we give our lives to Jesus, we are not only forgiven, but also shielded by His presence. Psalm 91 reminds us that those who dwell in the secret place of the Most High are covered by His shadow. God’s presence is a fortress that no evil can penetrate. Those who trust in Him are safe, even in times of trouble.

Many seek safety without salvation, but that is impossible. You cannot have the peace of God without having peace with God. When you are saved, your life is hidden in Christ, and no weapon formed against you prospers. Salvation gives eternal safety, both in this world and in the world to come. Therefore, make Jesus your refuge. Run to Him and stay in Him, and you will experience the safety that only a child of God can enjoy.

Challenge: True safety begins with salvation. Make sure you are saved, and remain under God’s covering through daily fellowship with Him.

Prayer: Lord, thank You for being my refuge and fortress. Keep me safe in Your hands and help me to remain steadfast in Your salvation always.


DAY 6:				AIM FOR THE MARK 

Scripture in Focus:  Philippians 3:1-15.


Learn by heart: "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus,"  Philippians 3:14.

Paul writes: "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect [mature], be thus minded: and if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you". Paul describes the Christian as a marksman. In Paul's day, the mark would have been hit by an arrow, but in our day, the mark must be unbroken by distractions.

What to do: 
(1) "Forget what's behind you and around you and stay focused on winning the prize." He is not referring to your salvation. Jesus already purchased that and gives it to you freely by Grace. No, he is talking about fulfilling your destiny and obtaining the reward that waits beyond it. 

(2) Your bullet has to have the right amount of powder. Otherwise, it will start dropping off before it hits the mark. Your powder is your power! And where does your power come from? The Holy Spirit! Jesus said: "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem [at home], and in all Judea and Samaria [on the job and in your relationships], and to the end of the earth" (Acts 1:8 NKJV). So the word for you is - AIM FOR THE MARK. 


Challenge:	For you to get the Prize, you must press towards the MARK!

Prayer:	Lord, give me the strength and courage to press on towards the mark to win the prize.



DAY 7:			GOD SPEAKS THROUGH HIS WORD
 
Scripture in Focus: Colossians 3:16-17.

Learn by Heart: "The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life."  John 6:63 {NKJV}.

God will speak to you through His Word. Jesus said, "The words that I speak to you are spirit and they are life." To grow in faith, you must spend time each day reading through your Bible. You can't arbitrarily decide that one verse applies to you while another doesn't. "All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives...God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work" (2 Timothy 3:16-17, NLT). To profit in business, you must know your business thoroughly, otherwise you will be out of business. And the way to succeed in your Christian life is to make it your business to know your Bible. 

It's like the analogy of the sperm and the egg. Neither the male sperm nor the female egg is capable of reproduction. It's only when the sperm impacts and is embraced by the egg that conception occurs, leading to life and birth. And it's the same with your spiritual growth. When God's Word and a receptive heart come together, something is going to happen! Can you imagine communicating with your husband or wife with the help of an interpreter? How long do you think your relationship would last? The same principle applies to your relationship with God. Today, let God speak to you personally through His Word. 


Challenge: The word of God is the manual for a godly living.

Prayer: Lord, give me more grace to read and embrace your Word.



DAY 8:			ARE YOU PRODUCING FRUIT FOR GOD? 

Scripture in Focus: John 15:1-16.

Learn by Heart: “I chose you...[to] bear fruit-fruit that will last." John 15:16; NIV. 

What do you consider to be a productive life? More importantly, do you know God's definition of a productive life? Let's consider what it means to be a fruitful Christian. The word "fruit" occurs sixty-six times in the New Testament. Three different kinds of fruit are referred to: the kind we eat -- figs and grapes; biological fruit – Infants; and spiritual fruit -- Christ like character. The Bible defines this spiritual fruit as nine things: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23, NLT).Now you know the kind of fruit that God wants produced in your life. That's how He defines a productive life. Jesus said, “This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples" (John 15:8, NIV). 

The proof that you are a disciple of Christ is that you bear spiritual fruit. Perhaps you're a good "fruit inspector" when it comes to examining the lives of others. But what kind of fruit is growing in your own life? Are you growing more carnal or more Christ like? To know how fruitful you are, examine what's growing in your life. If you like what you see, keep doing what you're doing. If you don't, get down on your knees and pray, "Father, help me to bring forth fruit that glorifies You." 


Challenge: Any branch that does not produce fruit shall be cut off.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, give me the ability to produce fruit; fruit that will stand and last.



DAY 9:			STAND UP FOR THE TRUTH 

Scripture in Focus: 2 Timothy 4:1-8.


Learn by Heart: "Preach God's message...even if it isn't the popular thing to do," 2 Timothy 4:2 CEV.

Christ's virgin birth, His miraculous power, His sinless life, His death, burial, resurrection, soon return, and the truth that salvation comes only through Him offend quite a number of people. The mention of a hell for unbelievers, a heaven for believers, the absolute authority of Scripture, biblical mandates concerning sex, marriage, parenting, and the sanctity of human life are guaranteed to annoy most people. Where does God expect us to stand in such a culture? On the truth! Jesus often offended His hearers, including those who claimed to be His disciples (John 6:66). 

Recognizing that young Timothy would face rejection and ridicule from some of his hearers, Paul told him, "Preach God's message. Do it willingly, even if it isn't the popular thing to do. You must correct people and point out their sins." We're not called to be popular; we're told, "Be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere" (Acts 1:8, NLT). God's Word will offend some and liberate others -- so be it! (John 8:32). You must never be arrogant or offensive, but you must always stand up for the truth of God's Word. 

Challenge: Stand Up, Stand Up for Jesus.

Prayer: Lord, give me the power and courage to proclaim the Gospel truth in every situation.



DAY 10:			MAKING WISE DECISIONS

Scripture in Focus: Proverbs 2:1-12.

Learn by Heart: "Whoso harkens to...[Wisdom] shall dwell...without fear or dread," Proverbs 1:33. 

Think about the major decisions we make over our lifetime: choosing a mate, deciding where to live, and what career to pursue. Looking back, can you say you have consistently made the wisest choices?, We make choices based on what feels best, what's easiest...fastest...makes our kids happy...shuts up the boss...stops our problem for the moment...We buy wants instead of saving for necessities. We don't plan to fail, but unless we plan to win by making wise choices, we can end up getting the short end of the stick. Wise choices aren't usually quick fixes, selfish, or short-term; they involve planning, hard work, sacrifice, and resilience. But the rewards are huge." James says, "If...you lack wisdom...ask...God...and it shall be given" (James 1:5 KJV). 

The world spends billions of dollars seeking wisdom, but as God's children, we have the wisdom of the Creator of the universe at our disposal. When you develop the patience and maturity to make the wise choice instead of the easy one, you never have to live in “fear or dread" of the outcome. John Mason says that growing in wisdom means fearing God, pleasing Him, hearing from Him, looking to Him; choosing His way, staying humble before Him, taking His advice, receiving His correction, maintaining a prayer connection with Him, and knowing His Son personally (Psalm 111:10, Ecclesiastes 2:26, Proverbs 2:6, 3:13, 8:10-11, 11:2, 13:10, 29:15, Ephesians 1:16-17, 1 Corinthians 1:30). 


Challenge: Let God be at the centre of your decisions.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, give me the grace to consider you first in all my decisions.



DAY 11:				WAIT ON GOD! 

Scripture in Focus: Isaiah 40:28-31.

Learn by Heart:	"Wait on the Lord," Psalm 27:14 (NKJV).

	
When we become impatient and react without thinking, we can do damage to ourselves and others. Sometimes when we pray and God doesn't respond quickly enough, we decide to take matters into our own hands and things get worse as a result. When God tells you to wait, He is saying, "Trust me with the timing, the ways and means, and you will get a better result." David wrote: "I would have lost heart, unless I had believed that I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!" (Psalm 27:13,14 NKJV). It can be tough to wait on the Lord. It's much easier in the heat of the moment to lose your calm. 

Stop and look back. How did the hasty and prayer less decisions you made in the past turn out? Do you think this situation will be different? When you act in haste, you do things you end up regretting and having to apologize for. Impulsiveness got King Saul into serious trouble. Instead of waiting for the prophet Samuel to arrive and the priests to offer a peace offering to God ensuring their victory over the Philistines, Saul grew impatient, usurped the role of a priest, and offered the sacrifice himself. When Samuel asked him why, he replied, "I felt compelled" (1 Samuel 13:12, NKJV). "Samuel said to Saul, 'You have done foolishly...now your kingdom shall not continue'" (1 Samuel 13:13,14, NKJV).So, wait on God.


Challenge: It pays to wait on God.

Prayer: Lord God, let your Grace to wait upon You be sufficient for me.


DAY 12:			GOD'S FAITHFULNESS TO YOU 

Scripture in Focus: Numbers 21:1-10.

Learn by Heart: "If we are faithless, he remains faithful, for He cannot disown himself," 2 Timothy 2:13, NIV.

Here is something you should be very glad about: God's faithfulness to you doesn't depend on your faithfulness to Him. The Bible says, "If we are faithless, he remains faithful." Your mistakes may take you out of God's will, but they will never place you beyond His reach. Catherine Marshall tells of a great personal struggle she experienced after writing a novel entitled Gloria. She began the book in 1969 and abandoned the project two-and-a-half years later. To her, the shelved manuscript was like "a death in the family." Attempting to reconcile her conflicting thoughts and feelings, she spent time at a retreat house. And while there, she reread The Bible story from Numbers about a time when poisonous snakes filled the Israelite camp. 

The people recognized the snakes as punishment for their sin, and cried out in repentance. The Lord told Moses, "Make a [bronze] snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live" (Numbers 21:8, NIV). Catherine realized that just as the Israelites took that which had hurt them, lifted it up to God, and were healed, we can take our mistakes and sins, lift them up to God in prayer, and trust Him to heal us. She writes, "When any one of us has made a wrong (or even doubtful) turning in our lives through arrogance, lack of trust, impatience, or fear, God will show us a way out." Even when you stray, God loves you so much that He will draw you back to Himself again. "If we are faithless, He remains faithful." 


Challenge: Great is thy Faithfulness, oh God, my Father.

Prayer: God help me not to abuse your Faithfulness upon my life.



DAY 13:			WHEN YOU FAIL, JESUS PRAYS FOR YOU 

Scripture in Focus: John 17:1-21.

Learn by Heart:	“I have prayed for you." Luke 22:32, NKJV.

Are you involved in things you never thought yourself capable of doing? You never thought you would have an extra – marital affair. You never thought you would cheat, steal, and lie to get ahead. You never thought you would become jealous and resentful of someone else's success. You never thought you would neglect or mistreat your family. You never thought you would get hooked on pornography. You never thought you would become addicted to drugs and alcohol. You're not alone! Peter swore that he would never deny Jesus, but he did and not just once but repeatedly. Did Peter love the Lord? Absolutely. But because he was weak, he turned his back on Him. What a load of guilt to carry. No wonder he "went out and wept bitterly" . 

But Jesus knew in advance it would happen and told Peter that He would be praying for him. Here is an amazing thought: When you sin, Jesus prays for you! "Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them" (Hebrews 7:25, NKJV).Picture this: You're struggling with a sinful habit, while at the same time, Jesus presents His cleansing Blood to the Father and petitions Him for help and mercy on your behalf. Will Jesus' prayers on your behalf be answered? Of course. And like Peter, however long it takes, He will work with you until you're restored.


Challenge: Satan is not relenting;  he is still looking for whom to devour.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, please pray for me.


DAY 14:			INTIMACY WITH JESUS - THE SECRET TO VICTORY 

Scripture in Focus:  Philippians 3:1-14.

Learn by Heart:	"I want to know Christ." Philippians 3:10 NIV.

Paul said, "I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead." Let's take an in-depth look at this verse. (1)"I want to know Christ." In Scripture, the word "know" indicates physical intimacy between two people who love each other. For example, "Adam knew Eve...and she conceived and bore Cain" (Genesis 4:1, NKJV). (2) "And experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead.” What's dead in your life that needs to be raised? There is no problem that Christ's resurrection power can't handle. 

Now, how do you access it? When you make intimacy with Christ your top priority, you tap into His power. For Paul, it meant being beaten, betrayed, and beheaded. But it brought a level of intimacy with Jesus that can't be experienced in any other way. "Often, the strongest relationship bonds come from the suffering we go through together; trials that cause us to know, love, and trust each another in a newer, deeper dimension. Intimacy with Christ gave the early apostles victory all over.

Challenge:	 To be victorious in life requires close intimacy with Jesus.

Prayer:	Lord Jesus, I receive power to be closer to you every day so that I can be an overcomer every day of my life.
 

DAY 15:					DO IT TODAY! 

Scripture in Focus: Proverbs 3:27-28, James 4:13-17.

Learn by Heart:	"He said, 'Tomorrow," Exodus 8:10 , NKJV. 

Every plague God sent on Egypt mocked one of their gods. For instance, the Egyptians deified lice, so God sent them a lot of lice and frogs. Finally, Pharaoh called for Moses and said, "All right, I give up." But when Moses asked him, "When do you want me to get rid of the frogs?" Pharaoh's response was classic; he said, "Tomorrow." This is not good enough! Why would you wait any longer to have the frogs removed? But we do the same, don't we? We procrastinate by putting off the changes we know would be good for us. More importantly, today is the day of salvation, tomorrow may be too late.

Maybe because we are too proud and stubborn, or we believe it’s not possible. Whatever the reason-we procrastinate. It's one thing to know God can solve your problem and change your life. The truth is, Jesus Christ has the power to make changes in your life today. He will give you the power to begin and the power to keep going. It's not too late. He can put your life back together again. So the word for you today is: do it today! 


Challenge: Anything that is worth doing at all, don’t wait till tomorrow. Do it today.

Prayer:	I receive power over the spirit of procrastination today.


DAY 16:			KEYS TO ANSWERED PRAYER (1) 

Scripture in Focus: Hebrews 11:1-11

Learn by Heart: "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone that comes to Him must believe…”   Hebrews 11:6 NIV.

FAITH: Just as the right key opens the door, there are scriptural principles that guarantee your prayers will be answered. For the next few days, let's look at them. "Without faith, no one can please God. We must believe that God is real and that He rewards everyone who searches for Him"(v. 6, NIV). God doesn't necessarily respond to your need. Look around and you will see that everyone has unmet needs. So what does God respond to? Your faith! But Satan will try to fill your mind with doubts. You can believe God's Word in your heart even when your mind questions it. So stand on what's in your heart instead of what's in your head. 

Sometimes doubt begins with distraction. When you're distracted from God's promises, you start to doubt. And as you focus more and more on your problems, your faith begins to waver. When that happens, you must refocus like a laser on God's promises-and merely glance at your problems. Don't try to deny them, but don't give them undue attention. The Bible says: "When you ask for something, you must have faith and not doubt. Anyone who doubts is like an ocean wave tossed around in a storm. So don't expect the Lord to give you anything at all" (James 1:6-8, NIV). 

Challenge:  If you want answers to your prayers, have FAITH in God.

Prayer:	Oh Lord, give me Faith that can move mountains.



DAY 17:				KEYS TO ANSWERED PRAYER (2) 

Scripture in Focus: Luke 22:39 – 43.

Learn by Heart: "If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us." 1 John 5:14 NIV.

KNOWING GOD'S WILL: One of the surest ways to know you're praying according to God's will is to pray according to His Word. Use Scriptures to back up what you're praying for. Say, "Lord, you promised it in your Word, and am believing you for it." Sometimes there are things we want to pray for, but we aren't sure whether those things are God's will for us according to Scriptures. In that case, you need to ask God to give it to you if it's His will -- and to help you be satisfied with His decision. 

Saint Augustine prayed, "Grant that I may do Thy will as if it were my will, so that Thou mayest do my will as if it were Thy will."D.L. Moody put it this way: "Spread out your petition before God, and then say, 'Thy will, not mine, be done.' The sweetest lesson I have learned in God's school is to let the Lord choose for me." Now you may have to wait, because God's timing is part of His will. Be patient; it will happen. You may not see it yet, but God has promised and it's on the way. And remember, if He doesn't give you what you asked for, He will give you something better when you walk in Faith and keep a good attitude.

Challenge: Put the will of God first in all your petitions.

Prayer: Give me the courage and ability to pray according to your will, oh Lord.



DAY 18:			KEYS TO ANSWERED PRAYER (3) 

Scripture in Focus: James 4:1 – 8.

Learn by heart: "When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives.....," James 4:3, NIV.

RIGHT MOTIVES: The reason you pray is much more important than the words you say. The motive is the why behind the what. And having a pure heart that loves God and loves people is always acceptable to God. On the other hand, selfishness is unacceptable; revenge is unacceptable; manipulation and control are unacceptable; jealousy is unacceptable; pride is unacceptable; and praying to win the lottery is unacceptable. In fact, anything that's selfishly based is an unacceptable motive. 

The first and foremost reason for prayer is to develop an intimate relationship with God.  Jesus said, "If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you" (John 15:7, NKJV). When you focus on "abiding" in Christ, you will get a response to your "asking." James writes, "Your prayers are not answered, because you pray...for selfish reasons." The truth is, we're innately self-centred. That's why we need to purify our hearts on a regular basis-and that calls for examining our motives


Challenge: Determine to have the Right Motives when you pray.

Prayer:  Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before you, oh Lord.



DAY 19:				KEYS TO ANSWERED PRAYER (4)

Scripture in Focus: Hebrews 4:13 -16.

Learn by heart: "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy," Hebrews 4:16.

BOLDNESS: Boldness isn't arrogance, presumption, or a sense of entitlement. It's based on who you are in Christ. Redeemed child, you have a right to approach Him at any time. You must also know that you need boldness to overcome Satan's attempts to make you feel unworthy. It removes inclination to say, "I know God can do it, but it's hard to believe He will do it for me”. But the glorious truth is: Jesus has made you worthy! (Colossians 1:12). In other words, God will give you what you don't deserve when you're confident enough to ask Him. Plus, you're asking in Jesus' Name, not your own. 

You're presenting to the Father all that Jesus is, not all that you are. And here is another thought: When you have hidden sin in your heart, you can't pray with confidence. Unconfessed sin locks you in and shuts God out (Psalm 66:18). But the good news is, when you ask God to reveal your sin, He will. And when He does, you must deal with it, if you want to keep the lines of communication open. If God reminds you of a situation in which you didn't do the right thing, don't try to sweep it under the rug. Acknowledge it, receive His forgiveness, and then you can pray with confidence. 

Challenge: To approach God with total confidence, you need to amend your ways.

Prayer:	I destroy every attempt of the devil to make me unworthy before the Throne of Grace.


DAY 20:					BE FAITHFUL 

Scripture in Focus: Matthew 25:14-30.

Learn by Heart: "You were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things," Matthew 25:21, NKJV.


In Scripture, to be faithful means to be steady, stable, dependable, and consistent. Do those attributes describe you? They should, because faithfulness pays big dividends with God. "A faithful man will abound with blessings" (Proverbs 28:20, NKJV). Jesus said, "Many are called, but few chosen" (Matthew 20:16, NKJV). When it comes to faithfulness, God will test you in two ways: (1) Your faithfulness in someone else's vision. “If you have not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own?" (Luke 16:12, NKJV). 

If you're critical, caustic (bitter), complaining, competitive, or constantly comparing yourself with others, you will be disqualified for what God has in mind for you. Faithfulness calls for serving with love and humility. (2) Your faithfulness in small things. "His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things...For to everyone who has, more will be given...but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away'" (Matthew 25:23, 29, NKJV). God wants to know He can trust you. You prove that by how well you serve others and by your faithfulness in small things. Take a few moments to prayerfully ask yourself the question, "Am l faithful?" When you are, God will bless you.  


Challenge: It expected of you as a steward to be found faithful

Prayer: Oh Lord, help me to be fin all my dealings with  Kingdom matters.



DAY 21:			WHO ARE YOU DEPENDING ON?

Scripture in Focus: Psalms 34:1-10.

Learn by Heart:	"My God shall supply all your need,“ Philippians 4:19, KJV.

How can you tell when you're depending on people rather than God? When you get upset with your boss because you didn't get the raise you think you deserve. When you become angry with a loved one because he or she turned you down for a loan. When you do things like that, you're sitting at the wrong door waiting for your blessing! Yes, it hurts when your efforts aren't acknowledged. But you must understand this: God will use people as instruments to bless you, but He alone must always be the source of all your blessings! Ponder these Scriptures: "You may say to yourself, 'My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me”. 

'But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth" (Deuteronomy 8:17, 18, NIV). "When God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them...this is a gift of God" (Ecclesiastes 5:19, NIV). "She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her...silver and gold" (Hosea 2:8 NIV). That's why Jesus said, "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well" (Matthew 6:33, NIV). When you pursue God, sow generously into His kingdom, and expect Him to meet your needs-your efforts will be blessed. 


Challenge: Recognize God as the only source of true blessing.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, provide for all my needs according to your Word.


DAY 22:			A LOVE FOR GOD'S WORD 

Scripture in Focus: Psalms 119:1-11.

Learn by heart: "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." Psalm 119:105.
	
The Psalmist highlights two important things Bible reading does for you: (1) It shows your spiritual condition. David said, "How can a young man [and an older one] cleanse his ways; by taking heed according to your word" (v. 9, NKJV). (2) It shows you the direction you go. "Your word is...a light to my path." When you're faced with an important decision to make; don't know which way to go, God will guide you through His Word. David said reading God's Word, meditating on it constantly   and prayer provide the solution. "Teach me to do your will, for you are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me in the land of uprightness," (Psalm 143:10, NKJV). 

Many of the mistakes we make could be prevented if we stopped long enough to seek God's guidance. He knows what lies ahead. So "commit your way to the Lord, trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass" (Psalm 37:5, NKJV). Just like children need to be taught to cultivate a taste for healthy food instead of junk food, you need to cultivate a taste for God's Word. "Your word is very pure; therefore your servant loves it" (v. 140, NKJV).
 
Challenge: Today ask God to give you a love for His Word. That's a prayer He will answer! 

Prayer: My Father and my God, give me the heart to love your Word.


DAY 23:			WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MEDITATE? 

Scripture in focus: Psalm 1:1-6.	

Learn by heart: "I will meditate on your precepts, and contemplate your ways."  Psalm 119:15, NKJV.

Another word for meditation is rumination. Rumination is what a cow is doing when she chews her cud. The cow eats grass, chews all she can, and then swallows it. It sits in one of her stomachs for a while, and then-a little later, she burps it up-with renewed flavour. The cow chews on it some more and swallows it again. This process continues in all four stomachs. That's rumination. The cow is pulling every ounce of nourishment from the grass. And meditation is simply thought digestion. 

Meditation doesn't mean putting your mind in neutral and thinking about nothing. On the contrary, it's thinking seriously about what you're reading. For example, you dwell on one verse of Scripture and ask, "What does this mean for my life?" You talk to yourself about it and talk to God about it. The Bible says this: "Keep your minds on whatever is true, pure, right, holy, friendly, and proper. Don't ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise. Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly".  You need to spend time every day-a minimum of ten to fifteen minutes -- where you sit down, read a portion of The Bible, and think deeply about what you have just read. Then talk to the Lord about it in prayer. That's the starting point for spiritual change and growth. 

Challenge: Start today; read, study and meditates on Gods Words

Prayer: Lord, give me the spirit to be consistent in my meditation and devotion period.


DAY 24:			OVERCOMING SELFISHNESS 

Scripture in Focus: Philippians 2:1-11.

Learn by Heart: "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, rather, in humility value others above,” Philippians 2:3, NIV.

To think of others more than yourself is not easy. That kind of thinking goes against our natural instincts, but Jesus showed us how to do it. Hanging on the Cross, He took time for the condemned criminal hanging next to Him (Luke 23:39-43). As he was being stoned, Stephen prayed for those who were killing him, asking God not to lay the sin to their charge (Acts 7:60). Beaten and wrongly imprisoned, Paul and Silas took time to minister to their jailer. Even after God sent a powerful earthquake that broke their chains and opened their prison doors, they stayed for the sole purpose of ministering to their captor. 

How tempting it must have been to escape while the opportunity was there. How easy it would have been to look out for themselves and not worry about anybody else. But their act of love moved the jailer to ask how he might be saved. As a result, he and his entire family were won to Christ (Acts 16:25). People will take notice. You will never win others by being just like them. So here is the question you need to answer: How many of your friends and loved ones may come to know Christ if you demonstrate that you genuinely love them, instead of ignoring, judging, and rejecting them? Go ahead -- try it

Challenge: Consider others more important than yourself. 

Prayer: Oh Lord God, give me the ability to do to others as I want them do to me.


DAY 25:				EXERCISE YOUR FAITH

Scripture in Focus: Luke 8:43 – 48.

Learn by Heart: "Your faith has made you well,” Luke 8:48, NKJV.

There are three important lessons for us in the story from here:

(1) Recognize and seize your moment of opportunity. This woman understood that Jesus was visiting her town. There are "God moments" in life when you must rearrange your priorities, overcome your fear, and exercise your faith. If you don't, you will miss God's best. 

(2) Be willing to try a different approach. Since she couldn't get Christ's attention because of the crowd, this woman touched the hem of His garment and was healed. Many times, faith calls for stepping into the unknown, doing something you have never done before, and discovering God's Grace at work in ways you never expected. 

(3) Establish a precedent for others to follow. Until this time, no one in the Scripture had been healed by touching Jesus' garment, and this woman's faith opened a door for others to follow her example. "People brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed"(Matthew 14:35-36, NIV). 

Challenge: God is looking for people who are willing to take full advantage of God’s power. Be prepared.

Prayer:	Lord Jesus, add to my small faith.


DAY 26:			DON'T WITHHOLD IT-- GIVE IT! 

Scripture in Focus: Genesis 22:1-17.

Learn by Heart:  "Because you have...not withheld...I will bless you,"  Genesis 22:16-17, NKJV.

God won't ask you for what you don't have, but sometimes He will ask for the thing you really want to keep. Why? To see if there is anything you value or depend on more than Him. Abraham was tested like nobody else in history. But he passed the test and was blessed more than others in history. Imagine having God say to you, "Take now your son, your only son...whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you" (v. 2, NKJV). 

Little wonder Abraham was called "the Friend of God" (James 2:, NKJV) and "the father of all...that believe" (Romans 4:11) And when the test was over, God said this: "Because you have done this thing, and...not withheld...your only son...I will bless you, and...Multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand...on the seashore... In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice" (Genesis 22:16-18, NKJV). So here is the question: What is God asking of you? Are you wrestling with it? Are you withholding what He wants, or you are ready to cooperate.  Isaac was the hardest seed Abraham ever had to sow, but that seed produced a harvest of blessing greater than anything Abraham ever dreamed or thought possible. What is God asking you to do today? Give it to Him.


Challenge: Be obedient to what God is asking you to do.

Prayer:	Lord, make me a giver like Abraham.


DAY 27:			LIKE SEEDS GROWING WITHIN YOU 

Scripture in Focus: Thessalonians 2:1-13.

Learn by Heart: "The word of God...effectively works in you who believe. " 1 Thessalonians 2:13, NKJV.


When you read God's Word and believe it and act on it, it's like seeds growing inside you. Those seeds have life! In the natural world, you don't have to understand the process by which seeds grow; you just have to water, nurture, and protect them. And it's the same with Scripture. Paul writes, "You welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe" (v. 13 NKJV). Note this "effectively works in you." God's Word is self-sustaining; it doesn't require others to validate. In the New Testament account, when Jesus was walking on the water toward His disciple, Peter said, "Lord, if it's you...tell me to come" (Matthew 14:28, NIV). 

Jesus gave him one word, "Come" (v. 29 NIV), and Peter started walking. The other disciples probably didn't believe Peter could do it. That's because they didn't understand who was speaking to Peter. "They thought [Jesus] was a ghost"(Mark 6:, NIV)! There is a lesson here for us all. When God speaks to you through His Word, don't expect everybody to understand, agree, or support you. He confirms what He told you through others, and sometimes He doesn't. But as long as you feed on His Word and believe it, it "effectively works in you." 


Challenge: Let the Word of God grow and work in you effectively.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, let your word work in me for fruitfulness.


DAY 28:		GOD WILL PROVIDE "ALL THINGS" YOU NEED 

Scripture in Focus: Romans 8:30-33.

Learn by heart: "Will He not also...graciously give us all things?" Romans 8:32, NIV.

One author gives this analogy: "Suppose a man comes upon a child being beaten by thugs. He dashes into the mob, rescues the boy, and carries him to a hospital. The youngster is nursed to health. The man pays for the child's treatment. He learns that the child is an orphan and adopts him as his own and gives the boy his name. Then one night, months later, the father hears the son sobbing into his pillow. He goes to him and asks about the tears. 'I'm worried, Daddy...about tomorrow. Where will I get food to eat? How am I going to buy clothes to stay warm? And where will l sleep?' The father is rightfully troubled. 'Haven't I shown you? Don't you understand? I risked my life to save you. I gave my money to treat you. 

You wear my name. I've called you my son. Would I do all that and then not meet your needs?' Honestly, now. Did God save you so you would fret? Would He teach you to walk just to watch you fall? Would He be nailed to the Cross for your sins and then disregard your prayers? Come on! Is Scripture teasing us when it says, 'He has put his angels in charge of you to watch over you wherever you go' (Psalm 91:, NCV)?" You know better, don't you? So stop worrying, and stand securely on His promise that He will "graciously give us all things."


Challenge: Do you still believe? God Cares!

Prayer: My Father and my God, thank you because all you have is graciously mine.


DAY 29:			HOW TO BE FINANCIALLY SECURED 

Scripture in Focus: Proverbs 11:24-25.

Learn by Heart:	"The righteous give generously." Psalm 37:21, NIV.

Giving is an act of confidence in God, and it's the only way to overcome financial insecurity. Think of all the things in life over which we have little or no control; illness; accidents; Job losses and economic conditions. No wonder we're insecure! The Bible says: "One person gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but comes to poverty. A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed" (Proverbs 11:24-, NIV). To the rational mind it sounds foolosh, but to the kingdom mind it makes good sense. Paul writes: “A few seeds make a small harvest, but a lot of seeds make a big harvest. 

Each of you must make up your own mind about how much to give. But don't feel sorry that you must give and don't feel...you are forced to give. God loves people who love to give. God can bless you with everything you need, and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others" (2 Corinthians 9:6-8, CEV). In your hand, a Naira will never be worth more than a Naira, but when you sow it into God's kingdom, it begins a harvest you can reap when you have a need. Giving is truly the key to financial security. 


Challenge: What you sow is what you reap.

Prayer: Lord Jesus, give me the heart to give generously and the discernment to sow in a fertile land.


DAY  30:		YOU MUST TELL YOUR CHILDREN 

Scripture in Focus: Genesis 18:11-19.

Learn by Heart:	“Tell it to the generation following,” Psalm 48:13.

Here is a sobering verse: "Another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord" (Judges 2:10, NKJV). How did it happen? Their parents failed to tell them. Read these three Scriptures carefully and prayerfully: (1) "Tell it to the generation following. For this God is our God forever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death" (Psalm 48:13, 14). (2) "We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord" (Psalm 78:4, NKJV). (3) "One generation shall praise Your works to another, and shall declare Your mighty acts" (Psalm 145:4, NKJV). 

As a parent, you're called to govern your own home. As a parent, you're called to educate your children in the ways of the Lord. You get the first bite of the apple! So give your children deep spiritual roots, starting as early as possible. Will they rebel? Possibly; the Prodigal Son came from a good home and he rebelled. But he "came back," because he had memories and values to return to. Approaching the end of his life, Joshua called the nation's leaders together and said, "You yourselves have seen everything the Lord your God has done" (Joshua 23:3, NIV). Then he instructed them to tell their children. Did they do it? No. And what was the end result? Their sons and daughters ended up marrying outsiders and adopting their sinful lifestyle. Don't let that happen to your children. 


Challenge: Be a good example for your children, both in word and in actions.

Prayer: Oh Lord my God, help me to teach my children your Word and commandments.
